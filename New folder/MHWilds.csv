xSinek,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xSinek/,"Monster Hunter Wilds: A Majestic Hunt Marred by Technical Hiccups

Capcom's Monster Hunter Wilds emerges as a grand spectacle in the action RPG genre, offering players an expansive and immersive hunting experience. Set in the enigmatic Forbidden Lands, the game introduces a richly detailed ecosystem teeming with life, where every creature plays a role in the intricate web of survival.

Strengths:

Immersive Ecosystem: The game's world is a living, breathing entity. Monsters interact with each other in realistic ways, creating dynamic encounters that feel organic and unscripted.

Refined Combat Mechanics: Building upon its predecessors, Wilds offers a more streamlined combat system. The introduction of the Focus Mode allows players to target specific monster parts, adding a layer of strategy to hunts

Narrative Depth: Departing from the series' traditional approach, Wilds places a stronger emphasis on storytelling. Characters like Alma and Nata bring emotional weight to the narrative, making the journey more engaging.

Accessibility: The game introduces features aimed at newcomers, such as improved tutorials and a more intuitive UI, lowering the barrier to entry for those new to the series.

Areas for Improvement:

Technical Performance: Despite its visual ambitions, Wilds suffers from performance issues across platforms. Players have reported frame rate drops, texture pop-ins, and occasional crashes, detracting from the overall experience.

Visual Consistency: While the monster designs are impressive, the game's environments sometimes appear washed out, especially during certain weather conditions, leading to a less vibrant visual presentation

UI Complexity: The user interface, though improved, can still feel cluttered. Navigating through menus during intense hunts can be cumbersome, potentially disrupting the flow of gameplay.

Multiplayer Integration: Some players have encountered difficulties with the multiplayer system, citing challenges in forming parties and maintaining stable connections during co-op sessions.

Conclusion:

Monster Hunter Wilds stands as a testament to Capcom's commitment to evolving the franchise. Its rich world-building, enhanced combat mechanics, and deeper narrative elements mark significant strides forward. However, technical shortcomings and certain design choices prevent it from reaching its full potential. With future updates and optimizations, Wilds has the promise to solidify its place as a standout title in the series.

Quamsi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Quamsi/,"I have played every monster hunter game since Tri at least twice, and I usually play to complete the HR100 or equivalent boss on every save. I also played the older live service games, Monster hunter frontier and Monster hunter online. Here are my thoughts on wilds (HR70/50 hours in game at time of writing):


Positives-

POOGIE IS BACK

Monster hunter wilds is really fun, and anyone familiar with the series will like it a lot. The gameplay loop hasn't changed, and capcom has implemented a ton of quality of life changes that make it more accessible to people who want to hunt more and grind materials less.

The new monsters are all really cool, along with their weapon and armor designs. Capcom does not miss when it comes to aesthetics in these games.

As a veteran hunter, I was worried the combat in this game would not be as enjoyable as previous titles, and while hunts are the easiest they have ever been, the attacks and animations in this game FEEL SO GOOD you basically don't notice. I have not used seikret or mantels during combat to make it more challenging, and used un-upgraded starting armor through LR6, but throughout the whole story (both low and high rank) I only carted [died] about 3 times, and did not fail a single quest. I was planning on avoiding using focus mode and exploiting wounds as well, but honestly they are so fun and satisfying to use I would sacrifice the difficulty for the satisfaction. Despite the lack of difficulty, the gameplay loop and game feel is worth 70$ to me personally.

The story in this game is... an improvement from previous entries. The characters, cutscenes, and storyline are more involved and compelling than previous installments, but to be honest, I don't think many people are playing monster hunter for a compelling story. unga bunga hammer go bonk, and all that

Overall, the game feel is impeccable, and I will probably end up putting at least a couple hundred hours into it before its G/Master rank expansion releases in a couple years. Capcom has already promised half a dozen or more free title updates over the next year that will include new monsters and loads of event quests and other things to do in the game. For me at least, the $70 is worth it to satiate my addiction to this series.


Negatives-

Performance is really bad. I have a Ryzen 9 5950x and a 3090 and I am playing this game at 4k high, raytracing off and getting 45FPS. This is playable for me because I spent a decade playing on a 3ds outdoors at 20 fps, but understandably many people are not willing to play a 70$ game below 60fps or able to afford a PC capable of more than 30fps.

On top of the low framerates, graphical bugs are not uncommon either. I personally have experienced the ""black triangle"" 3 or 4 times in my 45 hours of gameplay, which causes a flashing black triangle to fill about a quarter of your screen for 20 seconds or so for no apparent reason, which makes the game almost unplayable while its happening.
I have also seen the ""PS2 graphics"" bug, where some models appear to have about 100 polygons like OG Final Fantasy 7. For me this happened once after fast travelling and it resolved itself after about 3 seconds. I personally have not experienced any game crashes (I'm on the latest version of Windows 11 with the latest graphics drivers).

In classic capcom fashion, the menus in this game are heinous.
in particular, setting up multiplayer is particularly problematic until you figure out the system, so I will explain what you need to do to get it working the way you expect it too:

Basically, you want to have your friends in a lobby AND a link party at the same time.
The lobby is basically how you can see your friends in the overworld, while a link party allows you to go on quests together as a group. you can go on quests together using either one, but for the best experience, you want both.
To set it up:
1. you want one person to create a private lobby after selecting their save data on the home screen.
2. after loading in to the game, that player should get the lobby ID by going to the member list screen (start -> tab 4, labelled ""communication"" -> member list). The lobby ID will be displayed on the right. This player should send that lobby ID to everyone they want to play with.
3. The other players should select ""lobby search"" and then ""find a lobby based on ID"". (finding from in game or steam friends lists seems to have a 30% or less success rate, lobby ID works every time in my experience).
4. After loading in to the lobby, one player should go back to the member list mentioned before, and go to the ""lobby"" tab, then select and invite the other players to a link party.
5. The other players then need to accept the link party invite, either by holding the plus button on their controller after they receive the notification, or by going to start -> communication -> invites -> received invites.

From here, players will be able to see eachother in the overworld (because they are in the same lobby) and will automatically be able to join quests the other players post (because of the link party). Keep in mind a private lobby can have 16 players but a link party is only 4, so your lobby can have 4 groups of 4. You can also join quests from outside a link party by talking to Alma, so you can do quests with anyone else in the lobby, its just less convenient. You can have a link party between players in different lobbies and a lobby with no link parties, but you probably want both.

lastly, I personally found the music to be a little underwhelming compared to previous entries.

None of the negatives are severe enough to be a deal breaker to me, especially since most of them will (hopefully) be patched out.

EDIT:

After thinking about it a while last night, I realized that what really sets the old world games (everything before Monster hunter world) apart from the more recent ones is the feeling that you are really in an intense fight with a monster. I cant really put my finger on what makes that difference, but it has something to do with the players ability to move more freely in current games. Old world games required a lot more intentionality and commitment to attacks because a poorly timed or spaced attack could cost a cart. I feel like I can get through basically any hunt in Wilds by mashing buttons on my controller while wielding a sword and shield, but I do look WAY cooler doing it in wilds than in any other game.

Part of what I enjoy about monster hunter is the community aspect. Joining a random quest to get materials you need and finding people spamming stickers and gestures and having fun in post game is as relevant as the combat itself to me. Those kinds of interactions aren't as accessible in old world games as they used to be (albiet not impossible to find).

I'm playing with 2 different groups of friends so I am having fun helping them progress through the game while using my own time to do fashion hunting and grind materials for melding armor spheres and artian upgrades. Capcom added event quests and more weekly challenges today. Even if I don't enjoy this game the same way I did old world games, I am still having a lot of fun playing it and it still feels like there is enough for me to do (although I wish there was more).

While it doesn't impact my review of this game at all, I would encourage anyone that enjoys wilds as their first monster hunter to play an old world game like Monster Hunter Generations Ultimate.

DarkRanger57,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DarkRanger57/,"After 60 hours, hunting every monster, and hitting HR 75, I think I can say this is a good entry into the Monster Hunter franchise.

The elephant in the room is of course being the performance and technical state of the game. Quite frankly, this launch is unacceptable. There's no reason for my new rig with a 4070ti and a Ryzen 5 7600x should be struggling to hit 60fps at 1080p. It seems like they really want you to use frame generation on your first bootup as a magic bandaid, but that's not how this works. Bad performance is bad performance. This alone would normally get me to give it a negative review.

But dammit, this game is so fun. It's all I've been thinking about lately. In terms of the core gameplay, this is the best monster hunter has ever been. Everything feels good to use, every weapon is fun, every fight is cinematic, and every monster is diverse, and in my opinion, more interesting than the monsters in base world.

That being said, it's not all fantastic. The other elephant in the room is the difficulty of the game, which has been a hot topic, and has been since World even. This was my experience: I played most of the game solo or with a buddy, and I honestly didn't see much issue with the difficulty. I'm not a Monster Hunter expert, but I'm not a beginner either, so I expected low rank to be a pushover and it was, no problem with that. High rank saw a boost in difficulty, primarily with the Apex Predators, that I was happy with. Not too hard (which will come in master rank I'm sure) but not brain dead. I rarely carted throughout the game, but I also played previous Monster Hunters and still had to actually fight. From my memory this is about the experience I had in World as well.

But then I decided to play some 4-player SOS missions, and the dynamic changed entirely. Most monsters rarely attacked since they were constantly getting hammered, wounded, and stunned, including late monsters. World wasn't entirely difficult either, but this slaughter wasn't as common place even with 4 other players. It feels like the game was balanced for solo and duo play and not much else, the monster health is super low and the wound status rate is too high, which just creates scenarios where 4 players wail on the monster creating perpetual wounds. A big appeal of Monster Hunter is the multiplayer, which makes this a bit of a disappointment. Teaming up in Monster Hunter usually always makes it easier, but it really shouldn't be this much of a leap to where hunts end almost as soon as you reach the monster. This WASN'T the case in World, I still felt like 4-player hunts were fun in that game even if it was a tad easier.

In general, multiplayer is the weak point of this. Needlessly complicated to even get into a game, in some cases even a downgrade from prior games in terms of accessibility. I don't see the reason for the distinction between Lobbies, Link Groups, and Environment Links. It just seems overly complicated and poorly explained. And of course, the famous communication error makes a grand return.

Arena missions are missing as well, which is unfortunate. Some of my favorite memories of previous Monster Hunter games were teaming with a friend to get the best time with the pre-selected gear setups, but that aspect of the game is gone. Hopefully it makes a return in a future title update or in the Master Rank expansion. (EDIT: Confirmed for title update 1!!)

And then there's some general gameplay changes, i.e. the Seikret mount, no monster tracking, easy escapes and heals. To be fair, most of these were introduced in Rise and were just brought back to this, but generally I don't think they were needed and likelycontribute to the lack of challenge veterans are experiencing. Hunters and Palicoes have more tools now than ever before, but the monsters haven't been buffed to match (yet) and it's starting to show the divide. Again, low and high rank are all that's available, so I can't say whether this is necessarily good or bad yet, but I can't deny some of the Monster Hunter identity seems to be lost. Tracking and searching may have been shallow, boring, and frustrating in the other entries, but it was a part of the charm of actually hunting the monster. You could argue with that gone you can get right to the good bit, which is the fights, but then it just ends up feeling like a boss rush game and less like a hunt, especially when ""prep-time"" feels like more of an afterthought now more than ever.

That being said, I have still thoroughly enjoyed my time with this game (and not done yet!) and think it's still some of the best gameplay the series has to offer, which at the end of the day is what draws me in. This is the perfect starting point for a new hunter and has a lot to offer. Just keep in mind Monster Hunter is famous for confusing progression and menus, and just have fun with it without getting bogged down too much. Looking forward to crown hunting (yes I'm crazy), updates, and Master Rank!",Recommended,4097,65.2 hrs on record,Posted: 12 March
ya_mama--,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ya_mama--/,"To say I've put in quite a few hours over the past few weeks would be an understatement, so obviously I had a good time. If I take away some of my bias, it barely passes the recommended line though, and definitely with some caveats.

Caveat 1: Optimization
Let's start with the elephant in the room. The game runs worse than QWOP. You need a top of the line rig and preferably 2 to 3 mods in order to ensure it runs smooth enough on higher graphic settings. If you own a more affordable PC, there are about 10 different optimization guides and a reddit megathreat to help you out with making the game playable.

If that's not your cup of tea, don't buy the game until they fix this premium priced mess.

I started with Monster Hunter Rise, and it was the same story back then. The new mechanic made the game too easy. Now I hear similar arguments about Seikrets making the game too easy.

I think a lot of people understate the fact that escape mechanics are relatively trivial in the long run. When I started in Rise, I needed that escape to succeed quests. As I got more experienced at hunting monsters, it started to feel like an easy escape button. After hundreds of hours the ability became trivial since I had mastered my dodges and evades.

When I started in Wilds, I very rarely used my Seikret escape button. It's because I came in with thousands of hours of experience. Experience that translates to this game, because at its core it's still a Monster Hunter game. As the title updates and eventually master rank will arrive, we will see a bump in difficulty, until we min-maxed those end game builds. Then everyone will be complaining again that it's too easy.

I don't think the same applies to new players though, or the ones that play every now and then. Monster Hunter in general is very overwhelming if it's your first entry into the series, and I believe Wilds strikes a good balance between difficulty, survivability and most importantly...fun. There is very little that stops you from playing the game. There is almost always something you can do through skills, items or abilities.

In other words, if you are a veteran looking for a difficult Monster Hunter game, I can't recommend this one. If you are new to series, and have a NASA PC at home, and are willing to install mods, I can recommend this game.

I hear a lot of complaints about how the series is turning away from its original purpose. I can't account for that myself because this is my second Monster Hunter game. What I can account for is my own reason for why I boot up the game. It's to hunt monsters. And in my opinion, that's the most important part of a Monster Hunter game.

Hunts may or may not last shorter. Tools may or may not be unlocked quicker. I don't know. What I do know, is that the fights are amazing. In between the 10 million stutters, frame freezes and disconnects of course. Whether that's 4 veterans absolutely destroying a monster, or just you, your weapon and your skills. There is also a good variety of monsters, given that this is only the starting roster.

In order to get to the fun part you do need to put in some hours though. Monster Hunter is notorious for feeling clunky at first. There is a flow which most people only start to appreciate after they have spend a substantial amount of time with the combat mechanics. Once you have found the weapon that fits with your flow, hunts starts to feel like dances with the monsters, and it feels great. That's why I keep playing.

If you're down for that, then I can recommend this game. Again, provided you have a NASA PC at home and a Nexus account for some optimization mods. If you are looking for elaborate preparation rituals and a deep understanding of the game in order to beat monsters, then this is not the game for you.

If you want to play with friends, there are lobbies, squads, link parties, hunter friends and two different voice chat channels. It's a confusing mess. Once you know where to look it's quite simple of course, but you need a 5 step guide to help you do this for the first time.

If you are more of a solo player, you can't cue up for SOS quests. Instead the game shows you a list of all the SOS quests that are ''available.'' You have to manually click on one, request to join, wait, click away a message that says you can't join the session, click away another message that says you can't join the quest, back out of the quest menu, select another quest from the list, and repeat the process. Just host your own quests, it's much better for your mental health.

Lastly I want to touch on 2 more points. The story is alright. It actually ties into the locales you visit and the monsters you hunt. It also has some cool lore bits if you are into that. But it's nothing to write home about. The monster themes on the other hand are absolute bangers.

If you want to have some fun hunting monsters with or without others, then I can recommend this game. It has a good starting roster of monsters and there is more to come. The combat will take some time to get used to, but after that there is a lot of fun to be had if you ask me. Even when you got fights down to a science. Aside from the actual fights, it has little else going for it. Hopefully, for now.

However, the game is optimized so badly that I can only recommend it in good faith if you have a very solid PC. If that's not the case, I would wait until they have rolled out enough patches to at least make the optimization mods obsolete.",Recommended,4489,559.6 hrs on record,Posted: 22 March

My first impression after 20 hours of game time, I feel like there are a lot of aspects that have been simplified.

There are no more hunting monster tracks. You just get on your mount, and it will carry you to your target automatically.
Another aspects I like in Monster Hunter is how important preparation is, but in Wild, that doesn't realy matter. You forgot to bring a warming potion, oh don't worry, the game has you covered.

I could write a lot of paragraphs complaining about how much easier this game is compared to its predecessor, but maybe people are tired of it.

However after 80 hours. I finally realized that Wild is a better game for me, at least now, since I don't have much time to play games anymore, let alone having to hunt one monster for up to 60 minutes.

malrodin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/malrodin/,"Disclaimer: I played a ton of Monster Hunter so my thoughts come from that position. I'm not a 'purist' who outright dismisses modern MonHun, there's design decisions I have problems with but my focus is mostly on the product.
I'm mostly comparing Wilds to World considering these are ""A team"" games (stuff like rise/sunbreak is the B team).

4 key points: Content, Performance, Story, Gameplay.

Content Is always iffy on new Monster Hunter releases. The games are being treated like Pokemon, with an eventual big update dlc/expansion basically making the game feel complete. This is one of the more unfinished feeling experiences I've had with Monster Hunter. I don't say this just from the wealth of Monsters to fight, Tri probably had less, but there's a lot of gaps particularily in the endgame. The fact that the open beta had you fight the de-facto final boss of the game is mad to me. I genuinely had my final boss fight before the game released, it was way harder too which was super satisfying once I beat it. The game is also pushing stuff that feels like it should be basegame into content updates. The first big content update is huge but it also definitely should have been there in the first place.

Performance sucks. The game took 0 lessons from World (And the A team worked on this prior). There's just no two ways about it. You can watch someones youtube footage on a 5090 and they still get texture pop-in. World had massive performance issues at launch and the ones here feel especially eggregious considering World probably is a better looking game too. Try the benchmark.

Story I'm only mentioning because of how forced it is. They definitely wanted to focus on it more this time around but the problem is that it's just not good. It's painfully formulaic and the twist in the middle actually made me laugh out loud with how silly it is. My multiplayer experience with friends was hampered multiple times by one of us having to go through a forced walk-and-talk that you cannot skip. I don't think a strong story would not work in a monster hunter, quite the opposite, but it's definitely not exploring anything interesting with the setting.
Your character this time is fully voiced and also a total badass during cutscenes right from the get-go. Very hard to immerse yourself that way. I cannot understate how egregious it is that your character is being treated like a newgame+++ gigachad from minute 1. Usually monster hunter treats your guy fresh meat straight outta the academy, and you earn your badass status by working your way through challenges. Nata (the kid) gets introduced as the surrogate protagonist because you need a character who is even remotely vulnerable to have some stakes. The confrontation with the final boss may as well have had linkin park playing with how badass/edgy the setup was.

Gameplay. Lotta things I could talk about here. There's plenty of smaller nitpicks between a really awkward multiplayer lobby system and questionable weapon balance, but if I had to summarize the biggest issue with Wilds it would be something like this:
This is the Monster Hunter game where they want you to feel like a badass. Hunter movesets are far too powerful, Monsters did not compensate enough for this. You are consistently overpowering monsters at every stage of the game. As others have pointed out before, the game feels like you are beating low-rank monsters with high-rank gear. Hunter movesets were made to be a lot more mobile which is definitely fun, but it also means that positioning matters less. Why reposition for a big attack when you can just press the parry/counter that is completely reaction based, on a very very easy reaction no less. Parries definitely do not come at a premium in this one. A lot of talk was made about how the Seikret was an improvement over the wirebug from rise, but I think people underestimate how powerful the Seikret is. The game doesn't outright say this but you can get knocked down and still call your bird, completely saving you with plenty of invulnerability, making it functionally impossible to die given how calling it is free. This is by far the easiest monster hunter.
My guess is this is also why the Story treats you like a badass from the get-go. I think this is a deliberate decision by the devs. This is the game about the power fantasy of being a monster hunter, but it feels unearned if the challenges aren't really there (or your character does something badass in a cutscene).

The content and difficulty in this game are intertwined. The grind in Monster Hunter primarily functions as the endgame and replayability, giving you goals to do micro-optimizations to your gear, try different weapon loadouts, etc. Problem is they hand you everything way too quickly. An armorset can be completed in 2 hunts. Jewels you basically get shoved down your throat (and I didn't even do the farming exploit that was meta for a while). And why grind anyway if I'm already demolishing monsters. I don't really feel the improvements to my gear when fights are easy and they are still easy with better gear. Now don't get me wrong, I'm a veteran of the series, I'm not expecting to get challenged the same way here as I am with late-stage content of older games. But this is the only monster hunter where I just feel ""done"" with the game. I've seen it all.

The future for this game is a little iffy. They clearly shipped the game too early and are introducing more stuff with their scheduled content updates. I'm not certain they will fix core issues with the game however. They talk about looking into balancing and I certainly hope their 'careful language' there will bring the overall powerlevel of hunters down, but I doubt it. I'm probably coming back to it once the big ""rise2"" expansion releases, but until then, as I said, I've seen it all. I would still recommend this game as an entrypoint for newcomers if you have the PC hardware to properly run it. It's still monster hunter. It's still fun with friends and all. But after finishing wilds we went back to revisit sunbreak and had a much better time overall.",Recommended,5063,70.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 8
Aerilon1995,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Aerilon1995/,"As of current time of writing this, I'm 81 hours into the game. I took my time playing this, without skipping any dialogue for both main story and optional missions.
Monster Hunter: Wilds had a lot of issues for quite a lot of people, but my playthrough was completely fine and smooth. I just had to update my drivers and everything was perfect.
Though I usually wouldn't focus on a Monster Hunter story, this one had me intrigued a little bit and kept me entertained throughout. The game really does open up once you finish the story though, so I can imagine a lot of other people rushing through it. Having the entire main story be put within low-rank was a good idea, as it's like the tutorial part of the game where you understand the mechanic of the monsters and how they work before going into high rank. You can also learn different weapon playstyle while going through the story.
If you can get past all the optimisation issues, the gameplay is super fun and addicting, especially with all the different weapon playstyle. There's a playstyle for everyone in this game. A lot of improvements and new animations to every weapon from previous Monster Hunter games making gameplay feel fresh. The combat is as good as it gets for a Monster Hunter game.
Playing with friends definitely make the whole experience better, though it isn't a must. There are support bots now when you send out SOS, and they can be quite OP. They're better than a big chunk of the player base in the game, and they can't die too which does in fact make the game too easy. Speaking of easy, this is definitely one of the easiest Monster Hunter games out there.
As current time of this review, I'm currently HR69. Still got a lot more to explore, but so far everything's been great!",Recommended,1449,81.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 9

IT'S HUNTING TIME CAPCOM YOU BASTARDS YOU DID IT THIS IS THE BEST MONSTER HUNTER GAME EVER OH MY GOD

On a serious note, it's very amusing how it's often said that ""just adding more HP and damage power to an enemy is a lazy way to increase difficulty"" and yet Monster Hunter Wilds is an amazing example where this ""lazy way"" solves almost every issue with the combat. It's as if the MonHun team achieved a perfect difficulty for an experienced player and then said ""Great, now let's cut monsters' HP and damage by half"". Does this make the game less scary for newcomers? Yes, maybe even a bit too much. You can almost say that this is not just a good ""first Monster Hunter game"", it's a good ""first action game"". You can't win them all, Capcom knew that Wilds is going to sell millions so they decided to make the game very approachable on the difficulty front. However, if you're an experienced MH player, this results in very underwhelming fights - there is no struggle and there is no time to appreciate the design and the gameplay of the new monsters which are IMO much better than World's and Rise starting rosters. If you are on console/PC but not willing to tinker with the game, your options are:
1) beating the monsters in good-but-not-very-satisfying 2-10 minutes fights throughout the whole game and only getting to the interesting encounters by the very end of the endgame with level-5 tempered monsters. The ""difficulty diamonds"" is a system that is supposed to give a challenge to people who want it, but IMO it should come into play from the very beginning. I don't really care that Low Rank is supposed to be easy - if I see a jaw-dropping cutscene of a monster that threatens the whole eco-system, I want to be scared of the mf and fight for my life. Give me this option without mods, Capcom.
2) deciding to NOT use almost every mechanic of the game to create an artificial challenge for yourself. Never use palico, never eat anything beside a well-done steak, never use seikret in a fight, never upgrade your armor, never optimize your build... You can ""control the buttons you press"" only so much before you realize that you're actually avoiding 60% of the game to get an enjoyable experience. That's not how it's supposed to be.

It's just the beginning of the 6th gen, and MonHun team is already aware of most of our complains. The fixes, the title updates and the major expansion with Master Rank will make this game an absolute all-timer. Until then, god bless the modders and I highly recommend you to try the game with 2xHP and 2xDamage multiplyer for monsters (1.4-1.8x if you're already in the endgame). I'm willing to tinker with the game and not just go back to World, because the fundamentals of Wilds are really great - the monsters are absolutely incredible, the locales are gorgeous (please explore them on foot, don't use Seikret all the time) and this is the first time when MonHun team really tried to tell a proper story. Is it good? Well, so-so. But the cutscenes are perfect and I sincerely hope that they will use this experience as a stepping stone for the expansion campaign to be much better.

All in all, can't wait for the unavoidable Fatalis-level quest that will wipe us all. Happy hunting!

machomuu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/machomuu/,"OK so the performance is bad. I loved this game, continue to love this game, would recommend this game. It completely dismissed the worries I had after enjoying Rise so much that it'd have the same issues that World did.

BUT I do have some thoughts. A lot of small problems that just make this game really frustrating. These are in no way deal breakers, and in fact half the reason they bother me so much is because I like the game, it's very good.

Like first off, the story? Actually pretty good. I'm sure a lot of people probably skipped it and most people rushed it. The former's understandable, the latter feels almost intended for reasons I'll get to in a bit. Originally I was kind of annoyed because a sticking point I had with World was its emphasis on story, mainly because of how it portrayed it and how it was so intrusive. I figured, considering it was a big complaint for a lot of people, they would've cut down on it for this one. Instead they went the exact opposite direction and FOCUSED ON IT EVEN MORE. Now, again, I liked it, mostly because it had good pacing and the character dynamics were fun. It reminded me a lot of Monster Hunter 4's story, actually. There are some really good cutscenes and the ending bangs. Even if the dialogue can be pretty cheesily delivered (no shade to the VAs, they're excellent).

My problem mostly came with the fact that the story progression and how the game is advertised kind of run in conflict with each other. This is only an open world Monster Hunter in the sense that loading screens aren't a thing when moving between most areas. If you try to explore this world, particularly early on, there are multiple times where you'll be stopped and railroaded into doing a story quest. For most of the game, there'll be no monsters outside of the ones you experience in the story, so the areas end up feeling barren. Even the systems that do exist when you venture outside without a quest are half-baked versions of what they become later. This is especially notable if you're playing with friends, because it can be kind of cumbersome to do the story together and assuming you haven't finished it and just want to play together, depending on where you are there might not be that much *to* do. Compare this to Rise or the classic monster hunters where when you get to a new rank usually you're just given a bunch of monsters to go hunt and it seems kind of odd given the open world is kinda the selling point of this game. You'd kinda expect that you could go out and fight a bunch of monsters rather than just being met with vegetation and the one or two you've unlocked. The story always auto running you to locations (especially ones you've already been through) and pulling control away don't exactly always make them an exciting proposition. Especially when you just wanna. Y'know. Hunt Monsters.

Adding onto that, the UI in this game is. So bad. It's so bizarre, actually, because like...they had it figured out. Like, it was fine in Rise. Hell, I remember World's UI being better. But this game, I really don't know what happened. Visual clarity could be a loooot better, they've added menus menus and more menus, this game really loves its menus, the health bar is really small for some reason and the sharpness indicator doesn't have the same decrease feedback it did in previous games. Some things are just oddly presented in a way that feels like the developers thought it was obvious but I've seen enough people be totally stumped by to be pretty sure it isn't. I was actually so vocally frustrated during my time with this game, it's actually crazy that the UI is designed like this.

Anyway, all of that sounds bad. And it is, I guess, but I feel like that's also maybe a testament to how good this game is. The story can be frustrating at times but the actual experience of it, despite the cons that come with it, was pretty nice and it doesn't outstay its welcome. You're always going to new places and meeting new people and monsters, and there are soooo many new monsters. And once it's done, the game ends up being exactly what you expected it to be. Exploring the world becomes fun and comfy and rewarding, so many quests pop up, etc. While I don't necessarily agree with this game taking the ""Low Rank is the tutorial"" idea to its logical extreme, I can at least say that what the game set out to deliver on it delivers on really well.

Except the open world which isn't much of an open world. That's not a bad thing though, in fact I feel like this is the best case scenario for what this idea could have been. It feels very Monster Hunter.

Also the fights in the story are reeeally fun. There were so many times where I was just saying ""THAT'S SO COOL"" while fighting, and I was actually kind of surprised at what they were willing to put in there in terms of difficulty. It's not hard, exactly, but it's more aggressive earlier than I'd expect (in a good way). Weapons are more versatile than they've ever been and even though seikrets can sometimes be a bit annoying to control (please for the love of god STOP MOVING), their functionality is really nice and they're set neatly apart from their predecessors, the palamutes. This game just adapts to the idea of being so on-the-go really well. Also it's really pretty, especially when the textures aren't taking forever to load in.

I'm enjoying this game a lot, might honestly be among one of my favorites in the series (we'll give it some time). Yes, it has a lot of problems, technical or otherwise, but unless it just genuinely can't run on your computer then I wholeheartedly recommend this game. If you do, though, be sure to make your voice heard. Problems can't exactly be fixed if they don't know about them.",Recommended,4715,48.1 hrs on record,Posted: March 6

adventjx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/adventjx/,"Preface
Ever since our beloved series reached the eyes and ears of rest of the world, Capcom has made a valiant effort to keep Monster Hunter titles in check with various innovations to keep the series fresh and appealing to a wider audience. Remember the days when Gamespot gave Freedom Unite 5/10 for not having lock-on? Pepperidge farm remembers.

In this regard, MHWilds has, for better or worse, been dumbed down so hunters - veterans and newcomers alike - can have a stress-free experience to explore, hunt, and craft as we have all done before. Overall, the changes are welcome additions that make Wilds a unique experience in its own right, but as I assume most other veterans of the series probably do already, I also have a list of complaints to address. These issues are what compels me to still recommend MHW/Iceborne as the definitive MH experience over Wilds (at least for the time being). And sorry, but I'm not even looking at you this time, Rise. You're third place no matter what.

Positives
Core Gameplay
The core gameplay always centered around the plethora of weapon styles and their mechanics. From Greatsword to Longsword, SnS to Dual Blades, Hammer to Hunting Horn, LBG to HBG, the choices are there for you to pick up and eventually master depending on how much time and effort you invest into each of them. Wilds added many new convenient features to each weapon; in my personal experience, I've been enjoying Charge Blade more than I ever have and it has replaced Longsword as my main weapon since the days of MHW/I. This time around, the game also allows you to swap weapons on the fly to a secondary while mounting your Seikret, a feature that seems less impactful than originally intended, but a convenient feature nonetheless, especially for those who are lazy to go into their tents every half hour. The exploration, gear/build crafting, fashion hunting: it's all there. More of the same old same old, depending on how you look at it. And we're all here for it.


The lobbies and matchmaking in MHW/I were flawless in the first place. It wasn't hard to join up with friends in the same lobby, queue up for a quest, and hunt together. I've seen opinions about Capcom dropping the ball and making matchmaking worse somehow in Wilds, but I don't see it. The easy of access is still there, just not at first glance. The tradeoff, from what I can tell, is that they wanted us to always be roaming, always be seeing monsters everywhere we go without having to ""load in"" to an instance all the time. The quest queueing is still there, but the innovative option is easy to miss and give credit to. In terms of exploration, the only loading we have to go through is when we switch maps or queue into a quest (same as before), but we now also have the added feature of stepping out into a vast field of monsters right outside our doorstep. All in all, the tradeoff was worth it; wherever I am, I can step out onto an area of that map either on feet or on my Seikret and see a monster walking around - and I can hit. Beautiful, if you ask me. Almost - just almost - on par with Elden Ring levels of ""not taking us out of the immersion.""


The bread and butter in some aspects of what defines a game in the series. Some may argue the monsters in Wilds aren't as appealing as they could be, but the amount of effort put into their designs and fight patterns is admirable. They don't seem as copy and pasty as I feared they would be, and we see many returning faces as well as newcomers. None of the patterns for the launch monsters seem broken or out of the ordinary either. Obviously, the community is looking forward to many more being added to the roster with updates, but the initial roster seems solid enough to keep us entertained. My only minor gripe is that some monsters lack an ""identity"" of their own, a factor which contributes to hunts feeling repetitive at times.


Although the weapons feature numerous ""gimmicks"" and combos, along with unique focus attacks that provide a dopamine hit equivalent to successfully honing a weapon in Lost Ark (Dual Blades, thank you for letting me fly around like Levi, literally), this is the first MH title wherein I felt the combat became actually repetitive. The longer a hunt got, the more I found myself just wailing at a monster until it tired or fell. Don't get me wrong, this feeling exists in every MH game, but it has never been more prominent than it has in Wilds. This is the primary reason I consider MHW/I to be the stronger contender for being the definitive MH experience over Wilds; in Wilds, most - if not all - hunts end up becoming a gruelfest where I hope the quest just ends soon. And what's with all the monsters running away so many times? Arkveld runs away five or six times just because it runs out of breath or had its feelings hurt...


I have a confession. I have not once used a Demondrug or Armordrug yet, and I'm almost done with the core game. I also have not eaten a meal before every quest. Is the game designed so hunts can be just as quick without proper preparation? I honestly miss the days when I would have the step-by-step process so engulfed into my brain as second nature: tent -> pick build loadout -> pick item loadout/restock -> eat at canteen -> load into hunt -> pop demondrug/armordrug/seeds -> choose pod -> jump down into Nergigante in Origin Isle -> rinse and repeat. These were staples in previous titles, so what happened? Slotting in decorations and optimizing builds seem fun at first, but I don't really see them contributing to cutting down my hunt times as much as they used to. Maybe this will change once elder dragons come into the picture.


The number of times I had to google the location of a NPC I was already familiar with is proof that we need a gathering hub with all the NPCs lined up with their names and job description highlighted above their heads. That is all. Looking forward to it in the next free title update, Capcom!


If I don't mention this category, I'm afraid I'll be misunderstood as having liked the story. No. Not at all. However, I do acknowledge that I was never a Monster Hunter fan for their storytelling or quality cutscenes showing me how many lives I changed by hunting down monsters. That being said, the only parts I enjoyed about the story in MHWilds is whenever Alma gave me authorization to hunt a monster and I would respond with ""Acknowledged"" and walked like the baddest mf on the planet. That was... cool.


Although the core gameplay is there and the game is solid so far, MHWilds isn't a game I would recommend over MHW/I in its current state. As I mentioned in the preface, Wilds is more of the same in this humble veteran's eyes, and you can sit comfortably in front of your screen and take heart in knowing that even if you don't buy it now, the game isn't going anywhere. The $70 starting price point is also no laughing matter, so newcomers should avoid falling into the ""gotta play the new game"" trap and tackle MHW/I first if you haven't tried it yet.

Better yet, when you do come to Wilds one day, the game will more than likely have all the future updates available at your whim. The only thing potentially missing will be the influx of players to hunt with, but we all know there will always be hunters at your disposal. One final note in that regard: aside from the achievement that requires online hunting, I still prefer to solo everything without any issue just because I want get those focus attacks in without interruption.

yahrii,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yahrii/,"Monster Hunter Wilds had a lot to live up to, especially after the success of World and Rise. After spending over 60 hours in the game, I have a lot of thoughts. Some things are fantastic, others are frustrating, and a few are just downright disappointing.

At its core, Wilds is still a Monster Hunter game, which means the thrill of the hunt is there. The weapons feel great, the monsters are well-designed, and the gameplay can be really fun. But… there are some major issues that hold it back. So let’s break it down.

Gameplay - Fun in Its Own Way
Monster Hunter Wilds delivers a solid gameplay experience that feels unique and engaging. Despite its flaws, I find myself enjoying the core mechanics, and there’s definitely a lot of potential here.

Weapon Improvements - A Step Forward
One of the best things about Wilds is the weapon system. Every weapon feels like a refined and improved version of its Monster Hunter World counterpart. The movesets, mechanics, and overall polish make them incredibly satisfying to use.

Combat - Slow and Clunky Compared to Rise
Coming from Monster Hunter Rise, the combat in Wilds feels painfully slow. Rise had a level of fluidity that made the hunts exciting and dynamic, whereas Wilds feels sluggish in comparison. It doesn’t even come close to the sheer fun factor I experienced in Rise.

Multiplayer - No Real Sense of Community
Technically, there are plenty of ways to communicate, but the problem is nobody does. The game doesn’t naturally bring players together for multiple hunts; instead, it has this vague ""join a party"" option, which almost nobody uses.

Right now, it's basically: play with real-life friends or hunt alone with randoms who join through the SOS system. There’s no real way to meet new players organically, no sense of community where you can team up for an entire evening, discuss tactics, or just chat about real life. The old hub system encouraged bonding and teamwork—Wilds completely lacks that, and it really hurts the multiplayer experience.

Graphics - Unacceptable for the System Requirements
The visuals are an absolute disaster considering how demanding the game is. It feels like a downgrade from Monster Hunter World—everything looks blocky and grainy. At first, I thought it was an issue on my end, but after checking the forums, I realized this is a widespread problem. For a big company like Capcom, this is just unacceptable. My PC is well above the recommended requirements, yet the game still looks underwhelming.

Modding - Almost a Necessity
As it stands, mods feel like a requirement to make the game look decent. The fact that the community has to step in and fix visual issues that shouldn’t exist in the first place is frustrating.

Typos in the Config Files?!
This one is just baffling. There are actual typos in the config .ini files. It’s a small issue, but it speaks volumes about the lack of polish in some areas.

Final Verdict
Despite all its issues, the gameplay itself is REALLY good. But right now, it just barely makes up for the game's many shortcomings. Capcom needs to step up and fix these problems, because as it stands, Wilds is a flawed but enjoyable experience.",Recommended,2654,140.7 hrs on record,Posted: March 14
7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198024992671/,"This is my first monster hunter game. I spent about 20 hours in the various beta tests. during my time in the beta tests i went from saying ""i've decided this game isn't for me"" to being one of the ones who stayed up way too late on launch night to finally get to play it again. It took me a bit of time to get accustomed to the controls and figure out how to use my character, but once i had it, it hooked me.

is it a perfect game? no. it has its problems. but for the most part the problems are more nuisances than anything. To be fair, i have a fairly high end PC built in 2019, and i upgraded my graphics card to a 4080 a couple years ago. I haven't had any problems with performance so far. i feel bad for those that are having issues, but my experience has been virtually flawless.

Since this is my first monster hunter i can't really compare it to older monster hunter games. I will say that so far i have enjoyed learning the combat, learning monster patterns and finding new tricks and traps along the way. I have not completed the game, so i have not started into end game, but i don't foresee many problems in end game for my type of play. i don't mind grinding games. i have nearly 700 hours into granblue fantasy relink on PS5 and 200 - 300 in granblue fantasy relink on steam. i enjoy grinding and getting more powerful. so i anticipate the end game will be just fine for me. i will edit my review if that changes.

the couple of problems i have with the game are fairly minor. i get tired of monsters running away. and sometimes running for miles before finally stopping; even when they are near death. it gets so old trying to chase them down as your fully healthy bird can't even catch up with something that is hobbling and stumbling away with broken legs and wounds all over it.
the other problem is with trying to get into a group with friends. the system is beyond complicated. private lobbies are not easy to use and very complex for your friends to try to join. link parties aren't well explained and make no real sense. squads seem to be something akin to guilds. my friend and i are greatly confused every time we try to pair up. joining a lobby with each other often leads to us not being able to see one another. also, even if we are in the same lobby we aren't able to do quests together, you need to be in a link party for that (maybe? since i really don't have a clue) so it's to the point where we join a squad, a lobby, a link party, and then start a quest. for quests in the storyline if you are trying to do the campaign together, you can fight the monsters as a pair, but its janky. when fighting campaign monsters whoever joins the other one gets sent back to the main camp and from there they have to run all the way to the monster to take part in the quest. a monster that is probably half dead by the time you manage to join their quest and load their version of the map and run from camp to the monster; very cumbersome.

i have no doubt that these things will be slowly ironed out over time. it's too bad they weren't solved before launch, but ultimately it doesn't take enough away from the game for me to stop playing it. i am completely enjoying my experience in monster hunter wilds so far and i look forward to putting in many more hours.",Recommended,2654,81.1 hrs on record,Posted: March 2

I'm only about 14 hours into the game (realistically 10 hours discounting idle time), I don't know if I can recommend this game in it's current state. I'm running a Ryzen 7600X, 7800 XT, 32 gigs of 6000MT/s ram, and 60fps 1440p native is certainly not locked even WITHOUT ray tracing AND with some performance enhancing changes to the game's configuration file. The high res texture DLC exceeds 16 gigs vram and increases CPU utilization to hit 100% frequently, so I just leave textures at High rather than Very High.

So.... with all this in mind, I'm running the game on an SDR 1080p projector with everything turned up to ultra +rt with FSR nativeAA and having a very smooth, somewhat blurry but still buttery experience.

Performance aside....

+Combat is good
+Weapons feel familiar and powerful
+Monsters look amazing and intimidating
+Doen't feel grindy, repeating missions is fun. The loop is real and never unfun
+The core gameplay is simply addicting af
+If you came here to kill monsties and wear their remains... this is the game

-THEY GOT RID OF THE CANTEEN! NO MORE PALICO COOKS! WTAF CAPCOM??
-Auto running Seikret mounts are somewhere between convenient and a gameplay sabotaging mechanic (maybe I'm misunderstanding how to control them)
-I miss Palamutes, the gathering area, a lot of the home base features from Rise
-Story heavy content is not engaging. Discovering lore is not rewarding, dialogue is bloated, and I don't care about this kid or his village. Sorry, not sorry.
-Graphics are meh especially for how much strain they put on hardware
-This ditsy blonde smithy works red hot metal in a crop top, and has long ass hair near grinding wheels and large spinning gears like she wants to get scalped with 3rd degree burns, just saying
-This game is $70

If you have the best hardware, go for it. If you love MH, go for it. If you are just looking for a new fun game... look elsewhere. It's a good game for those whole know what they are getting into.




+30 hour Update:
I've made it all the way to end credits. I repeated a few missions several times. Never got old.
It does feel sort of bad to hit end game so soon for a $70, but Monster Hunter always has a ton of end game content that I am looking forward to get into. My system never crashed FYI even tho others report differently. I played exclusively in single player online. Just a few additional thoughts to add.

+Ray tracing performance hit is way less than many other games, in my experience anyway. Typically its a 1-10% fps decrease from off to high on my AMD GPU
+Some characters become more likable. I would have appreciated more interaction with Olivia especially
+The monsters get so much better in the last half of the game. They were already good, the last handful of fights were super fun

-I do not like the Seikret mounts! Aesthetically, behaviorally, and in gameplay they are inferior to Palamutes
-As a long sword and switch axe user.... combat was more dynamic and fun in Rise. Wirebugs had my flying around the screen doing insane combos and damage while staying out of danger
-""Mount and strike the monstie"" is inferior to Rise's ""mount and drive the monstie"" mechanic

Sorry for the long exposition.

TheRealHypnotic,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheRealHypnotic/,"Monster Hunter Wilds is another entry in a fantastic franchise that continues to grow every single year.

The game has its issues, more so at launch than now, but they are still there. Lets go over the pros and cons:

Pros:

Game play - Come on, this one is a given. It's monster hunter. Monster hunter will deliver you super rewarding game play as you hunt monsters, farm materials, craft epic gear and upgrade it over time. Play with friends and go on a hunt together to tackle all kinds of bosses from smaller enemies to gigantic apex predators. I don't think I ever had a boring moment in this game aside from some of the dialogue which we will get into.

Graphics - This one is a odd one for me. There are moments that monster hunter wilds really shows its beauty and there are others where its...mundane and washed out completely. One of the final areas of the game is really beautiful and the early starting areas leave a lot to be desired. Overall the graphics I think are definitely good but I wouldn't call them...death stranding mind blowing good.

Gear/Items - The gear in this game is AWESOME and fun to craft / hunt for. The build customization is varied and gives you a lot of options to play the game. There is a vast amount of weapons available to use that allow you to change up your play style and switch it up on the fly.

Value - This game offers tremendous value between the hunts, gear farming and crafting, item upgrading and online play. You will be in this game for hundreds of hours easily and not even realize it.

Cons:

Stability / Performance - This game has massive performance and stability issues. I have a top tier rig, 4090 and all and even I would experience visual bugs and glitches, dropped frames during certain areas or actions and overall just not a super smooth experience the entire time. This thankfully wasn't often enough to make me stop playing, but when it happens it is in fact annoying as hell.

Difficulty - Monster hunter veterans will probably have a issue with this game. I would'nt say this game is easier from a straight difficulty sense...I would say the game is more forgiving if that makes sense. It is the more forgiving nature that makes it easier compared to other Monster Hunter games. Veterans may have a issue with this however if you are new to MH, this would be for you.

Overall I think this game is a great entry into the Monster Hunter franchise and I just hope the performance is fixed over time to allow a great experience to flourish properly. If this game is ever on sale, its a immediate buy in my opinion.

The first MH entry I have properly played and dived into, and I've gotta say, I had a pretty fun time.

These are the things I liked:

( before i start I want to say that I had no bugs or performance issues personally, I know some people complain about that but in my experience, there were no issues with it.)

Now for the actual game:
The gameplay loop is pretty cool, it's simple and repetitive but it's also really well crafted, so I don't mind it.

The combat is very fun and offers a lot of variety with multiple weapon types.

But The story is horrible, I did not care for it for a single second, none of the characters are interesting, neither is the narrative or anything else regarding it for that matter.

Anyway, as long as you just forget the story and focus on the gameplay itself, you're gonna have a fun time, however I DO NOT recommend that you try to 100% this game, it was a VERY tedious and repetitive experience.

valinypse,https://steamcommunity.com/id/valinypse/,"Comentario Analítico: ""Monster Hunter: Wilds""

Se nos introdujo a la 6ta Generación de Monster Hunter el 27 de Febrero del 2025 por medio del estreno de Monster Hunter: Wilds, regresando a la dinámica y estética occidentalizada de World en lugar de la jugabilidad fugaz y estilo artístico Japonés de Rise.

Jugablemente es un total acierto; el combate y la kinestesia es excesivamente gratificante, el Focus Mode es sencillo de entender, los pseudo-chocobos son aún más cómodos que los Canyne y el detalle con el que está dotado cada escenario es milimétrico.

El ahora mundo abierto no se entiende como tal, en su mayoría vamos a trasladarnos por medio de viaje rápido y los recursos son recolectables a varios metros desde la montura; esto, sumado a saber siempre la localización de cada monstruo, puede significar un punto en contra para los habituados a las Investigaciones de World. Por suerte o por desgracia, quienes hayan sufrido los espantosos menús que esta franquicia lleva arrastrando durante décadas no tendrán que aprenderse nada nuevo, puesto que siguen siendo igual de horribles.

Mientras que World se conservó relativamente complicado hasta la actualización del Deviljho, Wilds es asquerosamente sencillo incluso para novicios. Es cierto que aún estamos en las primeras semanas posteriores a su estreno y ya hay grandes actualizaciones anunciadas, pero por ahora es un paseo por el parque incluso haciendo una Challenge Run en High Rank.

Ya todos sabemos que no hay quien juegue Monster Hunter por su historia, ahora en su mayoría presente en Low Rank y de mucho mayor peso e importancia que en cualquier título previo. No obstante aún sufre de grandes flaquezas, y si tanto nos quieren introducir a un mundo y a sus personajes, entonces deben hacerlo bien. Casi nada del argumento trata de monstruos nuevos, todo lo relativo a Gore Magala se presenta por la fuerza y la conclusión con Arkveld es demasiado inmediata. Quisiera encajarle varias trompadas a Nata pero es tan solo un niño; y aún así los adultos continúan llevándolo a la cuna de los peligros en zonas inexploradas, quizá sólo quieren deshacerse de él, no los culpo. ¡Por suerte volvió Poogie!

Respecto a la gran polémica que lo arrastró a una valoración ""Variada"" en Steam; sí, Monster Hunter Wilds corre tan mal como corría Dragon's Dogma 2, del que se redujo recursos en pos del desarrollo de Wilds. Son dos juegos preciosos en términos artísticos, el RE Engine da lugar a una escenografía fabulosa y muy detallada, pero mal optimizada fuera de escenarios pequeños de la gama de Resident Evil 7/8 o Devil May Cry. Esperemos que aprendan de sus errores para REX Engine.

Aislándonos de lo técnico, Wilds es un excelente sucesor. Todavía es muy temprano para dar un veredicto así que en próximos meses me veré forzado a actualizar esta reseña.",Recommended,2366,36.4 hrs on record,Posted: March 7

I have to say that I personally haven’t had any performance issues with the game.
However, I acknowledge that I have a powerful system, and weaker configurations might struggle. Still, I can’t criticize the game for problems that I haven’t experienced myself.

Just like with Dragon’s Dogma 2, I’m so happy to see a AAA project that isn’t running on Unreal Engine that I’m willing to forgive some of RE Engine’s quirks, even though it’s clearly not the best for open-world games.
It’s a shame that developers like CD Projekt Red decided to abandon their own RED Engine in favor of the more popular Unreal Engine. Cyberpunk 2077 is literally the most beautiful game right now, while Unreal Engine games often look similar to each other. If you play them back to back, it sometimes feels like you’re playing the same game over and over again.

As for Monster Hunter, the combat in this game is absolute cinema.
There aren’t that many monsters yet, but the developers have clearly focused on quality. The fights feel well-designed and polished. The game itself plays and controls very well. I think they’ll improve performance over the year, and there’s no doubt they’ll deliver more content. Fans have shown massive support by buying a huge number of copies at launch, so Capcom has no excuse not to support the game - unlike Dragon’s Dogma 2 (which, unfortunately, probably won’t be getting any DLC).

The story campaign is fairly short and simple, but it does a good job of introducing newcomers to the game’s overall vibe. However, while they made things easier for newcomers in that regard, the co-op experience (group creation, frequent disconnects, and inconvenient rejoining) could really use some improvements. A more seamless co-op system would be great.
Overall, the game is fantastic. The combat is exciting, though maybe a bit easier at launch (some mechanics have been simplified compared to Monster Hunter: World), but it’s still highly addictive!",Recommended,1724,50.6 hrs on record,Posted: March 28
neardeath55,https://steamcommunity.com/id/neardeath55/,"Now that the 1st title update has released it's time I re-review the game.

Performance still giga-crap, but I'd say the game's worth your money with this update or the second update TBH.

They need to make a way to make consistent *5 stars monster spawn, especially tempered and over all increase wound threshold. The difficulty in this game is very much a number balance, it doesn't need a rework of game mechanics or anything.

Other than that at this point I've gotten my money's worth but I still wanna keep going which is a testament to how much fun I'm having.

Original Review:

I love Monster Hunter. I love Monster Hunter Wilds a lot. So much do I spent 20 hours playing it from morning to night in one day (with breaks don't worry)

So many great adjustments from World and Rise. Sooo many. I have my gripes so far but it's so damn fun too.

I recently upgraded just so I have decent frames to play this game (and other games). So I have mostly stable frame rated, 60 and frequent food but still very much playable.

Make no mistake: I haven't even gotten out of low rank yet and this is an amazing game. If I'm having this much fun in low rank imagine how much I'll be having fun in high rank.

But I can't in good conscious recommend this to anyone. It runs bad. And it costs 70 bucks. Have they learnt nothing from from iceborne, DD2?

How on earth, did capcom go to optimizing amazing games on handhelds to... this??

If you think your pc can't rub this game -- don't bother. Wait for a sale. Wait for a pc upgrade. By the time you're ready to play you'll have new content and maybe even a new expansion to play

I can't see how capcom would come close to fixing this games performance, I want to be proven wrong but I doubt I will be. Maybe modding scene?

I will change my review at a later stage, probably if the end game systems impress me or if the first title update is really cool.

bluexy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bluexy/,"Monster Hunter Wilds, it must be said, has some very serious issues.

Performance on PC is the most pertinent. This game crashes not infrequently, it has in-the-moment texture pop-in even on monsters as you move quickly around them. And random serious issues like stings of massive frame drops appear and disappear day-to-day.

Monster Hunter Wilds' story is also unbelievably poor for such a successful and high-profile game release. It is a poorly written and uninteresting story. And its localization seems to have made it worse, like the localization team was told to make it for children watching 90s anime dubs. And efforts to try and make the franchise conscious of its problematic environmental themes are so forced and continue to fail in seeming intelligently thought out or moral. The story very rarely meets the epic feeling of its monster fights -- something it should manage at all times. Nata may genuinely be the worst video game character of the year.

The last major point I want to make is that this game has decades of iterative progression mechanics built into it that feel completely arbitrary and unnecessary. It comes off like a rushed sequel built on systems the development team didn't have the time to change or build on from Monster Hunter Worlds. For example, Low Rank is staggeringly easy and will require only casual interaction with weapon and armor upgrade systems. And yet there's a robust and diverse range of weapons and armor to make, and dozens of items which are required for crafting, which almost no player will use -- transmog doesn't even get turned on until Hight Rank, halfway through the game. Even in High Rank, however, monster parts for crafting are so easy to get that players will never have to meaningfully dive into the crafting systems if they choose not to. And worse yet, in the endgame of Monster Hunter Wilds, fights are typically so easy that players never have to think about their weapon and armor elemental/status strengths or weaknesses at all. The progression system may as well be scrapped as it is. It's a relic there only because it was what came before. It's baffling -- and dare I say unacceptable -- that a full-priced game so lazily implements such an important system. This should be the backbone of why Monster Hunter Wilds is worth playing on and on. But instead of needing to craft specialized weapons and armor to beat high-difficulty opponents, the only reason to make anything is for transmog or completion. Utterly disappointing.

AND YET

And yet, Monster Hunter Wilds is tremendously fun to play. Fighting monsters is incredibly fun, whether they're easy or difficult opponents. Thought difficult opponents is so much more gratifying to challenge yourself against. I've spend 70 hours getting my character to a point where I feel comfortable and confident against any monster in the game. I'll probably spend another 20-30 hours optimizing my build and just having fun. And of course I'll be back for the post-launch content and title updates, too, as much as I hate that it feels like they took content out of the game that it should have to release it later to retain players. Oh well. It's still highly recommended.

thehunterwild,https://steamcommunity.com/id/thehunterwild/,"Wilds is fantastic for what it is, but also missing a lot of opportunities. It's a good-to-great game that could be amazing, and knowing what it could be is disappointing. Overall, it's certainly got enough to make it worthwhile, but it's missing enough to merit the 'Mixed' review status.

Good:
Much of the 'good' is all the stuff that's always made Monster Hunter fun. Plus, it iterates fantastically on the last two entries into the franchise. Visually awesome, weapon changes are great, move sets are fantastic. Wilds is also an incredible entry point into the franchise for new players. Most of the weapons feel like they're easier to get started with but also difficult to master with plenty of deeper moves and combat flow; low skill floor but high skill ceiling.

Bad:
Open world with little incentive to explore. Soooo much missed opportunity to give you the opportunity to hunt the monster instead of just ride a bird-Uber to it. It should have two options: jump into the fight, or track and hunt for more rewards. Such a vast potential that is so underutilized that it's essentially a big L.

Multiplayer and UI is weak at best, as expected.

The new wound system is really awesome in a lot of ways, like giving you special Focus Strike attacks which often lead to powerful follow-up moves, providing more rewards, and also having a visual system to let you know where wounds are building up. The Focus Mode is another great addition here. But the wound system can also bring down the difficulty of the fights quite a bit. I've had many fights where I managed to open wound after wound with Focus Strikes, which can lead to chain-stunning the monster for serious chunks of time. That's definitely a big balance issue, when profoundly debilitating the monster isn't strategic or skillful so much as just what happens when using a basic system of the game.

Downside, they choose not to use latest DLSS + FSR, this is resolved using a swapper, and yeah it MADE things better using latest version.

Anything wrong with the game is not gameplay but optimization. Performances are not great all around, and you will need need to run Reframework mod if you want not just better perfs but also perfect ultrawide support.

Outside of that I have a few caveats with the game:
-Limited number of camps. Why?
-Many bugs when it comes to skills.
-Skills, as usual, don't tell you the value of what they give you most of the time, which is dumb.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198156021248/,"Monster Hunter Wilds is the next major instalment in the Monster Hunter series. What Monster Hunter Worlds had, Wilds sadly, just falls short on what World's had. Not completely in a bad way but it is missing the ""good"" stuff about worlds - the end-game. After playing for 30 hours I can now tell you what I think about it!

EDIT: Review is up-to-date as of 18/03/25

Below I will state any issues, my pros and cons but first a quick disclaimer!

This review is MY opinion, MY own personal experience and MY thoughts. I am brutally honest when it comes to reviewing games. If you do not like my opinion, my time or respect my personal experience, please move on.

Pros
⚫Monster Hunter Rise let you ride around on a palamute, in Monster Hunter Wilds you get to ride around on a Seikret that can GLIDE!?!?!?! I love it!!!
⚫So far, the improvements to weapons are amazing! Got my gunlance ready to be mastered again and now you can carry ANOTHER WEAPON!?!?!?! Now to swap between my bow and Gunlance whenever I want!!!
⚫Cooking has had an overhaul. Now, when you eat food buffs last a set time and they don't go away until the timer runs out, a bonus with this - the timer does not count down when you are in your camp... AMAZING!!! So much smoother now!!
⚫Each area is seamless so far. Full of life and stunning locales. Not only that, each area has weather that changes which adds to land itself. It really makes the land feel alive!!
⚫The monsters look stunning and all of their animations are just... spot on. I cannot tell you how much I love their animations and how amazing they look, especially with the HD texture pack.
⚫You can craft Artisan weapons which are insanely fun to use and to top it off these weapons deal devastating blows to monsters.

⚫I have seen a lot of people say that the game is ""TO EASY"" - okay, it is much easier. MUCH easier, BUT it's only just out. Give it time. They can always add in Tempered or Arch tempered monsters or heck... a new difficulty bump setting at a later date.
⚫Charging almost £10 for character edit vouchers is... not right. I am sorry but that's disgusting.
⚫I have had a few ""performance"" issues here and there. A bit of lag, stutter and occasionally my textures turn to playdough. Another case of ""RELEASE NOW - PATCH LATER"".
⚫The end-game is a disappointment. You are forced to hunt the same 6 monsters over and over again - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna.... making the other 22 monsters completely useless. You will hunt the other 22 about... 1-3 times each and then never have to fight them again. Read about the end-game below!

So, don't hate me if I got this wrong - You open your map, look for 1 of the 6 TEMPERED monsters you are ONLY allowed to hunt - Jin Dahaad, Rey Dau, Arkveld, Gore Magala, Nu Udra and Uth Duna - if one is there, you save it as an investigation and you go do 1 field survey of it, then do the 3 investigations.

If none is there, you go back into your tent, rest (set weather and time to your liking) and then open your map and have a look again. If none is there, repeat. If one is there do the step above.

I am sorry... but this is the worst part of MH: Worlds.

Coming from Monster Hunter Worlds and Monster Hunter Rise, Monster Hunter Wilds is definitely a step forward in some aspects but in others... 2 steps backwards, end-game and difficulty being the negatives.

If you are looking for a GOOD end-game, wilds sadly does not offer that, unless you don't mind brainlessly hunting the same 6 monsters for hundreds of hours for that one artisan weapon piece you need.

They have made Monster Hunter Wilds so much more approachable by making it easier for newer players. Do not judge it to harshly just now on that, its only just out, think towards the future for a DLC like Iceborne!!",Recommended,3124,41.6 hrs on record,Posted: February 28

Manage to play the game, after a driver update. Wouldn't say smooth sailing after that. Did encounter a hard crash afterward, not sure its the driver, the hardware or the game.

The game itself reminds me of World. Its easier to target with focus mode that committing to a strike is less punishing.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198098417419/,"Was incredibly excited to play this game, even counted down the days til launch. Now that i have it i spent $60 on a game i cant even play. It crashes on launch without compatibility mode on, but with it on the game runs but the textures are a mess and damn near makes it painful to look at. I've tried everything outside of learning magic to fix it yet nothing works. WHEN i get to play the game, it runs great, feels great, but looks awful. Otherwise i cant play it at all. Fix your ♥♥♥♥ Capcom and ill fix my rating. for now id give it a -10/10 if i could.

Addend; Now that I have finally been able to play this game I'd like to make good on what i said about fixing my review. I'm keeping the original here because I think it still applies to my overall experience though.
I have finally been able to play the game as intended. I STILL have no idea what caused the problems before, but my ""solution"" if you could call it that was to switch my AMD GPU out for an NVIDIA one. Otherwise the rest of my gear didn't change, but for whatever reason it solved the issue.

Anyways, my overall view on this game has significantly improved. It's a MonHun game so they're always good. The game plays well, weapons feel refined and well done. I think they really outdid themselves as far as monster designs go. Overall i think the game is super good. One thing I reaaaally liked is they took out a lot of the unnecessary grind the older games had. Don't get me wrong i enjoy really sitting down and grinding out a monster for a set i want but I welcome the shorter grind all the same.
BUT, it's not all positive. The story is incredibly intrusive, to the point that i actively disliked progressing because i knew I'd be locked into an on-rails section for a while, rather than having the freedom to explore or hunt something that wasn't related to the story. IMO the story itself really wasn't great either. I do like that they're at least trying to give us a narrative and lore, but It fell short in my eyes.

Another point I wanted to make regards difficulty. I've never really been on the ""MH is getting way too easy"" bandwagon but I gotta admit, the vast majority of the roster here is pretty easy. My first cart happened late into high rank. I main Bow and Hunting Horn so I don't think its the weapons i'm using. Either way the game IS still fun, but I hope Capcom will at least give us stuff that will really challenge us down the road.

Lastly, the thing that grinds my gears the most is the multiplayer functionalities. MY GOD is it ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stupid how to play with other people. You have to create specific instances just so you can play with friends. We STILL cannot go thru the story or cut scenes with friends, you have to basically invite your friends to every single hunt you do, and to top it all off if you want to explore an area you have to invite them to a separate instance just to play with them then. This all completely undermines the idea that this is supposed to be a big, seamless world. But what makes this so bad is that this is now a modern AAA game. Other games, including those from other Japanese companies, have been doing online connectivity so much better for decades. Capcom has gone on a crusade to streamline every aspect of these games, yet refuses to improve how playing a game that's MEANT to be co-op actually performs. Like just allow us to make normal parties/groups, have the host be the one in the cutscene if you cant incorporate everyone, and allow us to just exist in the same instance as each other. Then if someone posts a quest, a little pop up shows up prompting you to opt in or out of said hunt. Easy. Theres always the chance I just dont understand how it truly works, and if that's the case i'd love to be educated cause atm this ♥♥♥♥ is infuriating.

TL;DR: Originally I had a horrendous experience trying to play this game because it was seemingly broken. Once i got to play it was a largely enjoyable experience. I think Capcom did great with the actual ""monster hunting"" aspects, but fell short when it came to the story, lack of difficulty, and the incredibly agitating multiplayer functions.",Recommended,3377,183.3 hrs on record,Posted: March 6

oau,https://steamcommunity.com/id/oau/,"Launch: 6.5/10

Wilds does have its improvements, but after weighing the additions and subtractions, I still feel the shortcomings outweigh the gains. I don't mind if developers simplify the systems or reduce the grindy farming elements, but in return, they should provide enough content to fill the gaps left by these changes. By comparison, some of the features I loved in World—like photo quests, treasure hunting, and room decoration, among others—have all been removed this time.

I'm not sure if the vertical map design is a good direction in the long run; all I know is that its current implementation feels incredibly confusing.

The optimization is terrible. Even with all graphics settings maxed out, the visuals still don't meet today's standards.

It feels like they're trying to replicate World's long-term update cycle again, deliberately delaying the release of some content at launch, so it seems we'll have to wait for Wilds to get an Iceborne-level expansion to address its current shortcomings.

So far the gameplay is so good (a certain upgrade from worlds) that im even using different weapons each hunt and havent found one i hate so far.

to sum it up I haven't encountered any bugs or graphic problems. the different open world maps are so interesting & each village give you a dreamy feel. The music in harmony with the hunt, it's insane I love it !

Keep in mind, my review is based on my experience not other's. ik my rig is capable compared to the majority, so make sure you check benchmarks before buying the game, other than that it's a must buy if you love the hunt !

My only complaint is the nerf to the breast size from beta to release, it was already realistic, feminine & not overboard. but now it feels very weird and masculine... bad choice capcom !

Why can't I do the same thing with a game that released within weeks of each other even on Medium preset? DLSS has it's place but optimisation it DOES NOT replace.

Apart from the optimization issues. I believe this is probably the best monster hunter for anyone to get into. Not only does the story talk about the lore, but it also really emphasizes your role in the game as a whole. Monsters are pretty fun, and it has a good difficulty scaling in the base story, the High rank story does kick it up a notch or two.

peridotdot,https://steamcommunity.com/id/peridotdot/,"+ There is a story!
Granted it isn't the best story, but it's far more than Monster Hunter normally gives us. It almost feels like when they planned this, they decided to mesh together a bunch of clichés. It's not very original, and there is some annoying kid as well. But the cut scenes are breathtaking!

+ Representation?
Armor is no longer gender bound! And, instead of simply giving us one outfit, they stick with the same scheme they've done before! Which means each armor set has two armor types. One that would originally been for male characters and another for female. And now you can mix and match the pieces!

What else is there? There is a power mommy, a blonde blacksmith I swear is building her own harem and a scientific genius that is giving off mad on-the-spectrum vibes. Everyone is gorgeous. There is some some aestehtic to some of the tribes in the game I'd call arabic inspired and indian inspired. Which is nice and a fresh enough experience.

+ Mounts!
You have a trusty mount that looks like a feathered dinosaur. It's less clunky than the wolf you had in Rise. And you also have a saddle with materials rather than a chest at the beginning of a mission. You can also run past all the materials and gather them with your handy hook-tool

+ Another step toward more mainstream!
This might be a negative for the hardcore monster hunter fans but I feel like the developers have really taken another step toward the mainstream gamer population with this game. There is guilds. You not only get recommendations on what weapon to choose, but the Blacksmith will recommend what gear to build whenever you ask her. You also exit Low armor and start using High armor very quickly, and they start introducing end-game mechanics quite early imo. The game isn't grindy at all, yet atleast. The story introduces you to a single monster and doesn't ask you to kill it again. So far there also isn't any quests that says ""hit hunter rank x to unlock the next main story"" There ARE side missions, but with the story quest never taking a break I haven't quite gotten to it. Frankly, it is easier, more quality of life, less grind and if you're in a public lobby you see actual people running around. I hope the endgame will still be grindy and have difficult bosses, but I'm enjoying the story aspect of it all.


While I got lucky to escape the performance issues, I've seen several people that struggle.


Public Lobby? Private Lobby? Links? What's the difference? How do I play with my friends? It's annoying, and everyone gives you advice as if you're not stuck doing story missions early in the game. It is similar to the Worlds system where you cannot co-op during a cut scene. (And this game mixes cut scenes with walking-while-talking) and then a monster pops up. You cannot do the story part with friends, but once the monster appears, your friend can join your lobby (and/or link). Unlike Worlds, you don't need to cancel the quest and retake it but simply wait for your friend to run away from their monster and join you. Still annoying, but.. slightly better?",Recommended,2542,79.7 hrs on record,Posted: March 1

Ceruleansky69,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Ceruleansky69/,"The best game in its series


Monster Hunter Wilds is not far from ideal, but there is room for improvement. At first Capcom did a great job of ""Remove what didn't work, and make what worked even better"".
Wilds is a great entry point for newcomers to the Monster Hunter series.The game is very friendly and the learning process is well set up from the very beginning. The reworked and refined weapon mechanics feel great, each one feels like it's been given a new lease of life compared to how it was in MH:World. The ecosystem with monsters feels just great, and the fights with them even more so. Yes, some people complain that the fights with them have become ""too easy"", but these people have only seen the very start of the game, in fact, the further you progress in the game, the more difficult it becomes to hunt.


However, there is something to criticize the game for, namely its relatively high system requirements and not the best optimization of currently existing games. But this part can be fixed with patches, and if Capcom doesn’t give up on this, then Wilds can rightly be considered one of the best games in recent years. And don't be scared by the mixed reviews, they are mostly complaints about the technical part. If you are worried that the game won't launch, then first of all try the MH Wilds benchmark.


And even now with the technical issues the game feels great in all its other aspects, so don't be afraid to give it a chance, you'll have a great journey with your faithful feline companion Palico.

If you are a vet of MH or Souls style games you will find this version really easy playing through the story from low to high rank. Its really fun over all, more will drop as we go event quests when they start coming out I'm sure will bring some good fights for us. Story is around 30 hours if you are playing casually. Over all the story was good, I enjoyed the lore drops. I think partly the reason the game seems easier than other MHs is also that Our Hunter is not a new hunter they are designed to be stronger cause they are an Established hunter on route to being considered an ACE hunter if not more.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198037951083/,"Monster Hunter Wilds is the culmination of a lot of the design decisions that Capcom has made during the last generation of MH games; while this has resulted in very strong combat and world design, it has also meant the abandonment of what made this series unique in the past.


Monster Hunter Wilds has a much more developed story than previous games in the series. As a Hunter dispatched by the Guild, you and your team are investigating the enigmatic Arkveld and the events that surround the destruction it has wrought in the past. Similarly, the game tries to expand on the previously fairly ill-defined lore surrounding the Wyverian race, but neither aspect of the story is particularly strong.

The game waffles a lot. Lengthy conversations only ever ask for surface-level inclusion of the player by offering dialogue choices to merely probe for more information that ultimately doesn't really develop into anything substantial. Your own Hunter, most of all, is handled as a background character who is only a lever for character development for the surrounding cast. The worst example of this is Nata, a character who is rescued by the Hunter and the Guild early on in the story and serves as the introduction for this series’ flagship monster. He takes center stage for large swathes of the main story by virtue of his backstory. Nata might be freaking out at two monsters fighting—and the Hunter needs to go restrain him! Nata wants to be an apprentice Hunter, so surely you’ll be invested in his growth and participation!

It is less so that the writing across the board just isn’t fantastic—which is also not unexpected from Monster Hunter—but rather how hard it tries to make its painfully mediocre script touching and involved; and the talent for that is simply not there. This leads to the game being a much more boring experience than any previous MH title, where more basic but sparser writing was perfectly serviceable to get its ideas across.


Monster Hunter Wilds has introduced a lot to the series, the most extensive changes of which have taken place in the framing of each hunt. Instead of a single hub town from which players could initiate their quests, Wilds instead features a pseudo open world, wherein each biome is seamlessly connected within itself and features only a smaller camp instead of a hub area. This means that there is no separation anymore between preparation for quests and the action gameplay of hunting at the cost of all the small interactions players could have within these areas.

For instance, there is no housing, no decorations by your captured endemic life, cooking has been revamped, and many NPC interactions, for instance, for the procurement of random items between hunts, have also been adjusted accordingly. Broadly, I feel this has impacted the game negatively, as I just do not believe that this seamless transition was worth sacrificing what was essentially the vanity aspect of playing Monster Hunter. What it does, however, is capture what I had a feeling Capcom was moving towards even as far back as with the introduction of MH World’s Guiding Lands—to become as close to an MMO as possible. This is much more so the case in Wilds, as with the open biomes, players are by default joined into public lobbies where they can directly see all other players unless they opt into private or singleplayer lobbies. That being the case, Wilds' multiplayer functions incredibly well, and I have not encountered any issues in terms of network lag, disconnecting, or otherwise all throughout my playtime.

Quests have been slimmed down accordingly as well—and between the main story missions and a mere handful of side quests, all other hunts are dynamic and entered by engaging the random monsters on any of the maps. This, I do hate, as it means players are at the mercy of a spawn cycle they don’t really have that much control over. Fundamentally, this wouldn’t be very different from World’s Investigations, but given the massively trimmed quest list, it is instead the main way to progress during the postgame.

As for the combat, it is probably the best MH has been for quite a few years. The new weapon kits have all felt great, and the new wound system is a much more intuitive gimmick than both the Clutch Claw and Wirebugs of Wilds' predecessors. However, Wilds has also finally cut the ties of what the series has been moving toward for a long time by making monster tracking not even a question of progression anymore, but just removing it entirely. All monsters are constantly shown on the map—as they have to be, since the entire quest structure of the game depends on this. Likewise quietly removed are small combat aspects such as the possibility of getting dazed when getting hit or that the Seikret mount will be very happy to chauffeur you to any point on the map all by itself.

For as gorgeous and imposing as the world design is, it has left nothing about “Hunting” in Monster “Hunter”. It is, instead, a gorgeous but ultimately shallow train from killing one monster to the next. And while this experience, combat in particular, is heavily refined and as good as the series has ever been, it feels very soulless when considering what has been sacrificed for this.


Graphically, Monster Hunter Wilds is a mixed bag. It features quite muddy textures on many occasions, and human models in particular simply do not feel very accommodating for what kind of system requirements the game asks for. The lighting, however, is fantastic, and the environment very nicely reacts to the effects surrounding it—you might be in a rich field, in combat with a Rathian whose fire burns a small patch into the area—things like that are quite fantastic and help the game feel gorgeous when it needs to: During the exploration and action segments.



Weapons and monsters both sound great, and there remains a very crisp feedback to, for example, critical strikes. The music is about on par with previous Monster Hunter titles, though I did also find it fairly forgettable. Similar is true for the voice acting, which feels perfectly serviceable but not otherwise noteworthy.


Despite all the recent criticism around the game’s launch, which I am certain is justified, I have personally not encountered any issues with the game on the below-specified system:

Z790 UD AX
i7-13700K
GeForce RTX 4070
32 GB DDR5

This includes no crashes, bugs, notable stutters, disconnects, or other miscellaneous issues of any kind. I have enjoyed a perfectly stable experience, although locked to 60 FPS.


It is very early to judge Monster Hunter Wilds. Given that right now the content is very sparse due to the dependency on a regular content update model and the total lack of G-Rank until the inevitable expansion, I have no doubt in my mind that Monster Hunter Wilds will provide a tremendously great experience when it comes to the very core of Monster Hunter gameplay, primarily by virtue of abandoning overly intrusive combat gimmicks and perfecting the existing weapon kits. However, much like World, I heavily dislike what direction the series is moving into, and I believe with Wilds we have reached a point where these design trends have started to become an active liability—a totally nonsensical main story, the total removal of all vanity gameplay, and the misguided focus on larger and larger MMO-esque player lobbies have sapped my enjoyment of the game every step I have thus far taken into the as-of-yet lackluster postgame.",Recommended,6244,99.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 7

This one.

I've always fallen off of Monster Hunter games in some capacity - GU's ""go and figure it out"" approach didn't entirely click, World's ""sniff dirt for five minutes"" just made me frustrated and Rise's weird HP scaling and approach to co-op baffled me.
This game feels like they actually doubled down on all the parts that people want out of a Monster Hunter game, for better or for worse, while adding a lot of newer QoL changes from other kinds of games.

The menus are still baffling at points (what the hell is an environment link, anyways) and the game often wrestles control from you in which I can only describe as following from Rockstar's playbook with the Seikret dialogue sequences just requiring no input from the player, and it can be a little obtuse in other aspects too. But it wouldn't be Monster Hunter without a little bit of menu hell and some rough edges.

I won't address the elephant in the room - do your own research for your own hardware.
I can't lie at all, it's bad, but it was not my experience.

Auburok,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Auburok/,"I wasn't sure at first, but it probably is the best one. It's been a journey since the days of standing still to drink potions, the ""claw"", broken-in circle pad pros and underwater combat.

The menus are Kafka-esque; the party system is an obtuse facsimile of Nintendo standard practices circa 2010. However—once you've configured things you will likely stop bumping around unintended window panes like a junebug and figure out your preferred menu/UI ""flow"", as it were. Even if you don't, there are enough quality-of-life time savings in multitasking opportunities that makes up for it.

Gathering while on your mount, setting a waypoint and letting your mount path to it, ample fast travel options that you have some agency in laying out and the reduction of design choices or ""features"" (or however you want to frame them) that would have your character sit still and do an action while possibly three others wait on you. Locking onto an herb and gathering it while your mount takes you back to the scene of your cart feels less like a waste of time than the ""punishments"" of yore, meaning you're spending more time doing the thing we're all actually here for: hunting monsters.

It plays well, but that's dependent on your system. Don't use AI FrameGen tech; it sucks, and if you're competent you'll notice it and may not be aware of why things feel so mushy despite having such a smooth framerate. DLSS/upscaling has its own issues, but they are far less egregious. The game looks decent with things cranked up, but it feels like an overtly expensive lift even at medium settings. There is room for improvement, and it shouldn't just be something thrown to upscaling and FrameGen—both of those will benefit as well with actual optimization, so why not just go for the real gains (and be transparent if it is outside the reach of the dev team; sound the dinner bell so talented fans can help) that help hunters?

I'm not crazy about the story. It's a big focus, but I can hardly comment on it—I played with Japanese voices and fast-forwarded through the lion's share of the exposition (it's just the Hollywood version of what we've been rehashed since 2004). Sounds like English is kind of meme-y; your mileage may vary.

Lots to do, but room for more stuff, which appears to be coming. Currently it's up there with when it comes to player agency in-game, and if you've enjoyed any of the previous ones you'll probably enjoy this one, but it may not be for everyone.

Bad stuff:
- At this time there does seem to be a memory leak issue (no clue if it is RAM or VRAM related). That causes sudden game crashes after 30-120 minutes of play. Personal Update: Seems whatever update Capcom performed and an update I found for my CPU drivers (Ryzen7 5700G) have done away with this issue for me. Hopefully this has been fixed for the majority of players.
- The cutscenes are great but the character movements seem a bit wooden creating a minor ""Uncanny Valley"" response.
- Modern CPUs (not GPUs) are having a difficult time, occasionally hitting 100% usage. This can cause crashes if the timing aligns with you tabbing out to check whatever outside the game.
- RE Engine used for this game is starting to hit it's end of life and this title pushes what it is capable of (new engine reported to be ready this or next year).

I would recommend this to MH fans and anyone interested in getting into the series. The initial launch is not without its problems so please do keep that in mind and if what I listed above would be an issue for you.

Ryzen 7 7800X3D, 64GB DDR5 with an RX 7900XT w/20GB of VRAM. So yeah, pretty ok specs. Oh, and I'm running on Linux via Proton, so hard mode for new titles indeed.

Game autodetected my settings for Ultra. I declined frame generation, turned off motion blur. Capped my framerate at 60. After about 10secs in the game I can keep that 60 solid with a 1 or 2 frame dip in some areas. Downloaded the high res texture pack (holy hell, it's bigger then the base game) and things look pretty damn good. Only put 2.5hrs in launch night so far but zero crashes, no glitches.

So far very early on this is pretty much the most fun I could possibly be having with a new MH title. Combat is fluid as all hell to the point I was thinking the real monster was the controls for the last 4 in the series (DS claw, owww).

Only played Hunting Horn so far but the new mechanics are explained pretty clearly and really help make fights interesting.

I seriously hope people out there has the chance to experience this game as intended and CAPCOM heeds the feedback regarding performance, it's only fair and they owe it not only to their customers but to their own work, it'd be a shame not to let more people enjoy it.

Archill_YT,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Archill_YT/,"I won't go over the performance issues too much in my review because those are most likely going to be fixed and the game only released very recently. I also don't have too many issues personally but I know they are really bad for some.
There are a lot of fun moments (and a couple of headaches that I will talk about) that I think are really important.

First thing is that this is the first proper time I have played a monster hunter game, and it is really fun to use the combat mechanics the game gives to you. I don't know how fleshed out it is compared to other monster hunter games, but this one feels very fun and having the ability to focus on limb parts to deal bonus damage feels really satisfying.
The monsters (mostly) feel very fun to fight and are all very unique, there are so many you can go and fight or farm for certain armour sets and weapons which I believe is pretty much how the other games are. If you enjoyed that in the other games you'll enjoy it all the same here. There are also some nice quality of life changes compared to when I played world such as being able to stay in the mission area before going back to camp and overall just having a lot more control over what you want to do in missions.

As for story, I don't have a large focus on it but it is enjoyable for what it is. I like the characters more in this game than I did in worlds but I also didn't care for the story in worlds, so the bar isn't insanely high. I think the pacing could be improved in future, but it is relatively good and I don't have anything bad to say about it.

The main downside that I came across was trying to set up multiplayer with friends. I am not sure how it is in other games, but it feels so awkward to use in this game because you need to set up a link party, go talk to a specific person to go to that person's lobby (which can sometimes just not work because of story quests or other reasons) and then you also need to set up an environmental link every time you want to go out and fight something in the world. It feels like jumping through so many hoops just to do one relatively simple thing which is just to go hunt monsters with some friends. It feels like the game almost puts you off multiplayer intentionally just so you play through it alone, which I am fine with but I like having the option of doing some things with some friends.

TLDR: It's a really enjoyable experience and if you plan to just play it solo then you will probably find it really fun. If you're trying to do it with a group and play through the game with them, good luck figuring out how to do that because I couldn't tell you a solid method of doing so. As for performance issues, I do have a higher end PC so I don't feel them that much but I know there are some issues here and there, and hopefully they get patched and sorted out relatively soon.

[Edit]

After doing a majority of the achievements (almost done with those) I have a bit more to say about this game. The first note is the multiplayer interfaces are a little confusing but they eventually click once you get through the story. I think there are certain limitations with trying to do multiplayer with friends when doing the story, once the story is complete it's way less restrictive.

A lot of the monsters feel really fun to fight, most of them as mentioned before have really cool movesets especially the later monsters in the game. The decoration and artian weapon system is quite fleshed out in this game (im not sure how it is in other titles) and if you farm for it, you can become incredibly strong very quickly. This could be why the monsters feel a lot easier since we have some incredibly strong armour (the very last armour set, healing from a weakspot break is incredibly potent). It did take some getting used to for me to interpret the UI of my skills and what my armour sets actually do, but I eventually figured it out.

The difficulty compared to other MH games is so far on the easier side, although there are certainly still a couple difficult monsters in the game, but they are definitely not as hard as in other titles. That being said, there are updates to come in April and onwards so this could change.

Finally, the performance issues are still a little rough, they have gotten a little better but there could be more improvements especially for lower end hardware. Feels like the game could've taken another couple months (or longer) to polish these issues before launch. If you do plan to play this game, it would be recommended to have some sort of frame generation card just to help with improving smoothness and frametime when going through areas. I also noticed having the raytracing on low helps with some of the weird environmental bugs you might come across. To help maybe with some of the performance issues, try to make sure both your GPU and CPU drivers are completely updated, same with windows. This might not fix all of the issues, but it might be a nice thing to try and see if anything improves.

My final thoughts are that the game itself is really fun, it's a shame that performance does hold it back in the grand scheme but I hope that it bounces back (maybe in the next update in April?) and people can start enjoying the game rather than have frustrations with it.",Recommended,4301,101.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 2

Deszero,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Deszero/,"Fair Disclaimer

Most reviews out there are rarely unbiased takes, and I'm not ashamed to state that mine is no different and highly so for this game in particular. You've got a friend in me if you agree with everything stated here but even so, take it with a grain (or even a hand full) of salt.

Monster Hunter Wildin'

Oh, what a joy it is to be back in another 'MHW' game since World and after Rise. Though it pains me a bit to see the overall reception on it is 'mixed' albeit understandable to a degree. Most of the negative reviews are about the performance and optimization which is a valid point but also a case by case situation. One that is getting ironed out hopefully sooner than later, either by official means or through the community. But for myself, I can't really speak on it as it is performing more than well for me and I'm running it on a dated RTX 2070.

Outside of that, the game has been an amazingly fun experience to me and I'm still not close to being done with it if I am to compare it to my playtime in World. This review section doesn't have a high enough character limit for me to go into detail on all the things I like and would want to say about the game so I will try to compress it to the best of my ability. I will state that any comparisons I make here will be in regards to World as I think that is the most fair way to go about it, since Rise is obviously catered to a different (the OG) branch of MH.


I believe this statement is very appropriate and considering World is what made MH soar from niche to borderline mainstream, it's very telling on how I perceive Wild overall. Though opinions will always be mixed on even the littlest of things and new features, I dare say that it really is a true successor and improved on almost everything. I can go on indefinitely about each small detail but I think for me most of it really comes down to one big thing and that is:


World's environment already felt lively on it's own but Wilds takes it to another level in terms of immersion. The fact that all the locales are all seamlessly interconnected makes it so you can literally ride out of the towns straight into the fields and go all the way to the other side of the world map, if you so wanted to.. without ever having to see a loading screen. And if you're in one of the online lobbies that can hold up to 100 players (much less for private and squad), each base or village acts as a hub where you can see and meet other hunters. Now add that the entire world goes through a cycle of day and night, two seasons and even has moon phases for certain rare materials that have a literal blooming animation and other countless of events that can occur under certain weather circumstances etc. and let's of course not forget the different monsters that can and will visit with different conditions. It's only natural to have an option to rest for those that want to get any specific time of events.

Instead of having dedicated locations for eating your full course meals, it has now turned to cooking much smaller meals which some may see as a downgrade.. but overcompensating for this is the fact that you can cook pretty much anywhere you want, be it in your tent or out on the field.. with the understanding that the latter might not be the brightest if you have an angry monster near you. The meals can be customized and it makes much more sense to do so because of the different buffs and skills it provides. And to top this off for immersion sake, the animation and cut-scene for it is specifically tuned to each of the ingredients you picked; it's quite the gratifying sight to see. Cabbage with melted cheese and topped off with honey? why the heck not. And it's not even the biggest change and improvement, as now the food buffs are based on duration, 50 minutes.. or 30 if for some reason you choose to eat half a meal. And this persists through fainting and doesn't run out if you are not logged in. Much better than having to eat again after literally every mission. Finishing ingredients can be found around the world or obtained from trading with villagers giving even more incentive to gather materials. Other than that, there's the occasional invitation from different villages/villagers to eat a big meal which comes with their own high quality cut-scene and improved buffs with a higher duration. MH's food animations devs are to be praised as always.

Your Palico can talk English now.. and yes it can be turned off if you prefer to read nya-nsense instead. More surprisingly, we as hunters have an actual voice now to the point where some sequences in the story we can choose what lines to say and generally have small talks with all the characters in the world. A very pleasant upgrade from having a mute who is just getting ordered around.

Our handler is Alma and she's the first one in the franchise to be visibly present and active in the field, helping to gather materials, providing us with information and of course as people will find out and have been raving about.. be the one to give us the 'green light' on hunting each and every monster in epic fashion. Some may see this as hunters just being fierce beasts on a leash waiting to unleash their fury. But the more logical take on it is obviously that we don't hunt for pleasure, but to maintain a certain balance within the ecosystem; which goes through the guild's order and why we have handlers in the first place. I think for a lot people it helps that Alma is generally more visually appealing than World's handler was. Shallow as it may sound, it is still a glaring fact for most players. And let's not overlook the smoking hot smithy Gemma who gives off Cindy vibes from FFXV.


I realize that in these few paragraphs I've just been raving about things that may seem insignificant, especially to outsiders who have never played MH World or any MH game. I'm not even done talking about it in my eyes but for the sake of the world's sanity, I will cut it short here.

The game is truly a delight, that's all I really want to say about it. As for being informative for review's sake, it's something I consciously put on a lower focus as the game runs well for me, and everything else just feels either intuitive or reasonable. For those looking to hunt in groups or with friends, I can at least say it's somewhat easier to go through than World though still not perfect. It just requires making use of the link party feature and possibly squad feature/lobbies, which can be looked up on the internet if need be.

As it is, I really can't think of any significant downsides in comparison to World as whatever changes it does employ, it more than makes up for it through other means. But of course all of this can and will be very subjective for each person. In my geek frenzy I may have overlooked some things to note but I may still edit this and add to it if need be.",Recommended,5628,89.2 hrs on record,Posted: March 8
7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197995205213/,"It's Monster Hunter and it's a lot of fun. Luckily I didn't have performance issues so my opinion is viewed through that lens. I want to touch on some of the other negative opinions though.

Story and railroading. Totally agree that the on-rails seikret rides and back to back ""go here go there"" is frustrating and you feel like you don't have freedom to explore. It gets in the way of multiplayer and takes self led discovery out of your hands. However, this is the only time I've cared about the story and the characters and that's a good thing. It's a wonderful world and let's face it, anything before the credits is a tutorial anyway and you get true freedom soon after. It's also the most accessible entry point for new players to the series as it's not the most beginner friendly franchise.

Cooking. There are complaints of a lack of ingredient availability. This feels like people don't want to engage in any sort of gathering outside of monster carving and that seems odd to me as gathering has always been a core part of the loop. I haven't had any issues with collecting what I need and the meals last for 50 minutes with the additional ingredients so you're not needing to cook often. Couple that with free meals you can get elsewhere that last 60 minutes. There are complaints of a lack of beneficial effects from cooking. I can see that and that's fair. I hope they add more for variety. There are complaints of the cooking animation as we're missing felyne chefs. I thought it was strange at first but this is easily the best cooking we've gotten. If you're cooking then each ingredient you use is animated so you're actually eating what you're cooking. Incredible. Then there are shared meals across the world with differently animated feasts exploring different cultures of food and eating with different people. Not only do they look amazing, it builds on the connection with the people and the story of the game. We're not eating dango over and over.

Easy difficulty. This has been blown out of proportion. Yeah the story is pretty easy and you're not going to cart much if at all but did you in World before the credits either? It's certainly easier and focus strikes are a part of that but I don't think it's too easy and more importantly it's still fun. The main problem is the low health of monsters. Fights are over far too quickly even after the story. I'm not encountering those 20+min struggle fights before learning the movesets and bringing that time down. The really difficult fights have always been in the expansions and event quests so this is nothing new but I'd like to see the ones we have be longer. We've got a lot of tools at our disposal for very aggressive playstyles which makes faster fights an inevitability.

Not a perfect game and there're for sure things they could have implemented better. I want this game to be better. I want it to keep improving and get the largest monster roster to date to sink hundreds of hours into and we won't get there without criticism. I just think some critiques are misplaced and you should go in with a more open mind. Fans are often the least willing to accept change.",Recommended,2592,195.4 hrs on record,Posted: March 3
CuteGrillNoticeMePls,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CuteGrillNoticeMePls/,"Revised review after 170+ hours and having completed all content and achievements:

Performance:
The game looks great. It could run better and definitely needs more optimisation - but it is 100% playable.
My system is very average by today's standards. RTX 3080, Ryzen 9 5900X, 32GB RAM.
I'm playing the game with mostly high settings at 1440p. I've turned a few settings down to medium that have a high-performance hit and little visual difference such as anything related to shadows or foliage. I'm locked to 60FPS while playing, only dropping to the 50s in the more open areas during weather effects and/or when there are a lot of monsters.
This makes a solid 70% of the game locked to 60fps. 23% of my experience at 53-59fps. 7% of my experience at 45-52fps. I'm being as transparent as possible with those numbers. Am I saying that's good? No. Ideal? No. Playable? Yes.
I have never experienced a stutter (micro or otherwise), and I have only experienced one crash during my playtime. Others report these problems as more common. YMMV.

Frame Generation is not possible on my card. DLSS is set to Balanced. There is no visual downside with DLSS unless you're using Performance or Ultra Performance. And while I cannot use Frame Generation, there is no impact on latency if you use the Reflex setting. If you're not utilizing these features, you don't understand how your card works. These are features to enhance performance with minimal perceived quality difference to native. Utilise them.

The bottom line is, they were able to increase the performance by a substantial amount from the release of the first beta to the release of the second (which wasn't present in said beta). They can and will continue to improve performance. They're not oblivious to the problems. Your sale or lack thereof isn't going to change that. You're not making a statement. If you're (rightfully) worried about performance, test it and refund it before the 2-hour mark if performance is not ideal.

Gameplay:
The gameplay is amazing in every regard. The combat and combos are much more fluid and well-paced. It's very engaging. I could not possibly return to World. Easy (PC) GOTY for me.
There are complaints that the story / Low-Rank is too easy. I find that difficulty is subjective. If you were to go back to your first MH game, you would steamroll it, just as experienced players are getting through Wilds without carting for the majority of fights. Nothing will be as difficult as your first time learning your first MH. And that's okay. The end game is where the difficulty is. Certain Tempered monsters can cart you in 1-2 hits if you're not careful.

At my level of playtime, I'm deco farming, weapon farming, and crown farming. I feel like I've done almost everything I want to do with this game for now. And that's okay. These games get content updates for years. There will eventually be more to do. Comparing the release state of Wilds to the totality of World is not valid. Compare it to the release state of World instead, as World on release only had one more monster.

In my personal opinion, every criticism has a varying level of validity. The performance, although is an issue, isn't as big of an issue as people make it out to be. And the gameplay/difficulty/content criticism is subjective, but mostly in bad faith.",Recommended,2766,187.8 hrs on record,Posted: February 28

lutyrannus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lutyrannus/,"Monster Hunter Wilds is a phenomenal game, albeit with major flaws that users must consider carefully. The obvious one is performance, but I won't belabor it as the other reviews cover the issue well. Run the benchmark before buying the game. The second biggest issue is that the low rank progression structure is just bad. This is, unfortunately, the type of game that doesn't ""get good"" until about 15-20 hours in or so. I enjoyed the content of the story but it's really unfortunate that it basically ruined low rank for me, with consistent railroading and suffocating restrictions that end up feeling arbitrary and pull me out of the immersion this game tries to set up.

That being said, when this game ""gets good,"" it gets FANTASTIC. This has easily become my second favorite Monster Hunter game under only Monster Hunter 2 (dos) on the PlayStation 2. High rank in this game is probably one of the best experiences that one can get in modern AAA gaming, allowing the player to live in the world of the Eastlands and truly become a monster hunter, doing as you wish and engaging with amazing combat, exploration, and astounding vistas. Very immersive experience!

Hard recommend for anyone who has the patience to make it through low rank and a good enough PC. Stay away if you don't want to deal with consistent frame drops and bugs, or if you don't think you'll be able to sit through low rank.

lnhvx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lnhvx/,"Let me preface this review by saying that I haven't had any issues with performance on my end with my 4070Ti. If you're on the receiving end of any performance related issues, I'd wait for a potential fix, which they are hopefully working on.

I've been a fan of Monster Hunter ever since Freedom Unite and I've played every release since and while Wilds won't take the top spot for me, it's one of the better entries in the series and I've enjoyed it more than World on release.
The game is lacking in certain areas, sure, like the fact that we are missing some true endgame hunts that properly challenge the player. This has been a trend since World, though, and I'm happy to look past it as long as we get some through Title Updates.
Other than that, the combat is, in my opinion, the best it's ever been with more environmental interactions, new and exciting combos for every weapon type and the addition of wounds.
The graphics look amazing. The game switches between a colorful and a dull color palette, depending on the weather, which does a good job of immersing the player and really making us ""feel"" the weather.
The roster of monsters may be on the smaller side, but variety wise it's absolutely stellar. Also the new additions are amazing in my opinion.
The current endgame feels pretty good due to the addition of tempered AND frenzied monsters, and the fact that every weapon can be upgraded to rarity 8, a feature first seen in Sunbreak.
The cooking system has been a point of contention for many, which I understand. I think it works, although I would wish that they expand on that by giving us more ingredients to work with to really mix and match dished based on the fights ahead.

We're still missing a gathering hub, which will arrive with TU1. Hopefully alongside a room of sorts where you can place your various endemic life. Maybe even a new cooking cutscene involving Felyne as many, including myself, have been asking for it.

Overall, I think Wilds is a worthy successor to World, and it does many things better, some things worse. Here's hoping that they fix the performance problems, so more people can enjoy this game, and that the upcoming TUs add some much needed challenge in the endgame.

Base/City gives a bit some laggs, perhaps because online multiplayer lobby mode. Some places don't have much this issue.
It only feels like this game require a bit stronger computer to play this game.
Or else, I don't mind it too much. As long people can enjoy their hunting in missions, I believe it's fine!

If you have not played or heard about Monster Hunter before, then this is small basic info:
You are a Hunter/Adventure, with a companion called Palico. (Cat companion)
Explore the world and meet different Monsters and find some items/plants/mine to craft potions/buffs.
Slay or Capture different Monsters for rewards. And craft your gear from it to prepare more different challenge. (That has 14 different weapon types to choose, and different armors depend the monster materials you have)",Recommended,878,352.2 hrs on record,Posted: March 3

BritishGorilla,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BritishGorilla/,"TL:DR: Game is good, performance issues aside. CAPCOM should very much continue to hammer them out though, because people without brand new PCs will struggle to play at all. If the performance issues are a point of contention for you, you will probably want to wait for more patches to come out addressing them. If not, I believe you should wholeheartedly play this. See further below for specs and settings.

Game runs fine-ish for me with no crashes thus far but your mileage will vary based on your own specs. If your CPU is under powered, you will feel it. The polygonal triangle monsters (in this case) ARE real and CAN hurt you. PS5 controller users will also see the rarely used trigger resistance functionality come into play, so don't be scared that your triggers are suddenly locking up on you. You'll see instant zoom in/out on the map via L2/R2 click (this one can be disabled if wanted in the controller options) and other various small things during gameplay. If you're looking for camera and HUD settings in the main menu, you will not find them until you gain control of your character, which is a really stupid design decision in my eyes. This mostly has to do with some accessibility options that aren't modifiable for the most part in their own tab, in my case this was for motion sickness.

I'm only at the beginning of chapter 2 as of writing this, so I'll probably update this as I play through the game more and more. The story is pretty engaging thus far, and I'm much more of a fan of the handler this time around. Character speaking interaction also helps build the immersion a little bit more instead of just being a grunting and yelping hunter who stoically sits in silence.

The addition of the seikret is a very nice QoL for movement and gamechanger in general (especially being able to carry a second weapon into combat). I'm not a seasoned MH player, and I have had some difficulty with at least one monster so far, veterans of the series will probably breeze through low-rank monsters without issue no doubt. The world is very immersive and beautiful to look at, easy to navigate, and also without load screens from as far as I've seen to this point (rather replaced with transition hallways so to speak). I will also mention that I very much love being able to go straight from camp to hunting within seconds too. It helps things move along very fluidly.

Customization is built upon from World, with the ability to customize your seikret, your pop-up camps, hunter profile, and etc. Character customization is built on from SF6 and DD2 and look amazing when all is said and done, assuming you haven't built an absolute freak of nature.

I don't need to speak on weapons as there's already numerous amounts of information on them from the beta, I myself though have been really enjoying the insect glaive and hunting horn, the latter of which didn't feel good to use for me previously in World.

Edit 3/1/25: I've put in 8 more hours, cleared chapter 2, and it's more of the good stuff. HOWEVER... I am very tired of having my control ripped away when I'm not actively hunting a story monster. There are several points in the game where you're not allowed to do anything but progress the main quest. I also somehow keep swapping weapons while on my seikret, which is really annoying when I have a specific goal in mind when approaching combat.

I am also beginning to encounter much more stuttering during combat, to the point of absurdity.

Edit 3/2/25: I've discovered several things. Stutters mostly come from going over 60fps with framegen on. Having framegen on and purposefully tanking my fps resulted in less stutters. You cannot use VSync or framecap the game with framegen on. If you have framegen and Nvidia Reflex off, most of your stutters will go away.

There should be a way to turn off chat without having to go to a private lobby, and this multiplayer system is pretty stupid for trying to play with friends, especially going through low-rank the first time.

I am sitting at the last boss of low rank (initial credits). A reminder to everyone that the experience doesn't end at credits, and there's MUCH more after that. Half of my fights were much harder than they needed to be because I was ill-prepared with the wrong gear (for example, -13 fire resistance against a fire-type monster). Story's good with the exception of one party member who should have been written slightly differently. Every monster has felt fair so far up to this point, my own stupidity with gear aside.

I miss the Palico chefs preparing food, but thankfully I've been told that they're coming in a title update.


Performance stuff below and PC specs for reference:
AMD Ryzen 7 7700X 8-Core
RTX 3060 12GB
16GB of DDR5
Windows 11
Installed on an SSD

Upscaling is set to FSR3 at balanced w/ frame generation on (it's functioning much better than the beta, much less ghosting overall), rendering distance is set to medium (it's one of the only settings affecting the CPU for impact) with surface and sand/snow quality set to low. Everything else is set to high, maxed out, or turned on with the exception of ray tracing. Running at a resolution of 1080p. With those settings I am hitting 80-90 fps, frame generation makes up for half of that. If 30fps didn't make my head hurt, I'd honestly be fine with capping the framerate to 30.

That being said, however, there are stutters during gameplay which are absolutely annoying to deal with. It happens more frequently during battle, usually after attacks. During exploration w/o combat, it happens much less frequently. On the other side of the coin though, I've dealt with enough bad optimization in games to the point where it doesn't bother me really, even if this isn't eurojank or slavjank (terms of endearment really).",Recommended,4804,46.3 hrs on record,Posted: February 28

notabsolutelysure,https://steamcommunity.com/id/notabsolutelysure/,"The opening day dust has settled, the hardcore fans have reviewed, the people pissed off they couldn’t play definitely already reviewed, so with no bias, lets take an honest crack at an honest (prelimenary) review.

Only reason I say preliminary is because I’m only 8ish hours in, my first hour or so was spent unpacking the preload, installing the new NVIDIA drivers for Wilds and then letting it optimize shaders.

Now, performance is the hot button issue with this game so, how is it? Annoyingly, very system dependent, but overall definitely lacking. I personally did not have any truly significant dips, especially not during hunts, but especially in some of the later areas and cities I could feel it slowing down a lot. Missing textures, fuzzy textures, low framerate. I play a lot of Capcom games, and I think the RE engine is genuinely magic when it comes to small instanced rooms & buildings, but it really struggles with large open areas.

We’ve known that for awhile, but I guess Capcom doesn’t because they used it for Dragons Dogma 2 and Monster Hunter Wilds, both open world-ish games and both plagued by performance issues that could’ve been seen coming a mile away. Its worth saying that Wilds does not chug nearly as bad as DD2, but again, this is all hardware dependent so your mileage may vary. The first few hours of this game being out there was a 40% positive rating with like 8000 reviews (and almost a million people in game) because those first 8000 were mostly people upset their system wasn’t able to run the game. These performance issues were expected, and the game does run better than the demo or the benchmark, but it still most definitely needs work on that front.

All that being said, how is the actual game?



This is not my first MonHun but its my first time playing from launch and its nothing short of amazing. The monster design is, fittingly, absurdly high quality, the attack patterns, the environment designs, the music. From a game design perspective this is everything you could ever want out of a game where you essentially fist fight dinosaurs and skin them to wear their skin and fist fight them again.

They leaned a lot more into story in this one than previous titles, with full on cutscenes and characters that don’t just go “But, but the monsters are coming!!!” and then let you fight. There is a grander plot at play, and while it isn’t particularly complicated, it is there and worth acknowledging. They also made the blacksmith and partner insanely attractive, so points for that.

As far as gameplay evolution goes, pretty much every weapon got a fresh coat of paint. I play hunting horn and they added this new echo bubble mechanic where I can place them on the ground and they act as amplifiers for my songs damaging the monster standing in each of them for every song I play. Its completely changed how HH is played and makes solo hunting on HH significantly more enjoyable. They also did the favor to players of having AI companions fill in when you SOS beacon until real players join the lobby, though, so if you don’t enjoy solo hunts then you aren’t necessarily at the whims of people joining you.

Speaking of multiplayer, it is baffling to me that in 2025 Capcom still continues to make the active choice to not develop simultaneous story progression for co-op. You can hunt together and its a blast when you can but you cannot take story missions together so progressing the game is a solo activity. They really gotta get on this at some point, its overdue.

There are some missing features like layered armor crafting, a home base you can customize and decorate with endemic life you collect, and a few more minor things, but they have already announced that most of that (and more) is coming in a title update next month. They are moving fast and hard with content updates and I appreciate that, I just hope that performance updates don’t go by the wayside in favor of adding more stuff. The stuff thats already in game is great, and all that we all want is the ability to go hunt monsters at 60ish fps. This game is worth a pickup even at full price, assuming you are willing to gamble that it will run for you. Its most definitely going to be on my GOTY list come the end of the year, but if you do end up waiting on it for updates and a sale, Monster Hunter games only get better with time, and this one will be no different.

sheza-the-sergal,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sheza-the-sergal/,"This game has obvious flaws when it comes to game design as well as optimization. The game runs pretty good for me but my PC is also quite beefy. Yet I also encountered my fair share of graphical issues in my 22 hours of playtime. I think what bothers me most personally is the atrocious decision on how to handle the multiplayer, playing the story ""together* is tedious to say at best. The fact that you can't change maps once you get into an environment link is straight up ridiculous- This means every time you want to change maps you have to disband the environment link, change maps then reinvite your friend to the environment link again... just.. why??

But.. this is Monster Hunter. And it's a *good* Monster Hunter.
Fighting big beasties is as satisfying as ever. The weapons feel great and the focus mode is just such a good addition to the game compared to the .. ugh. clutch claw.

heathenhearted,https://steamcommunity.com/id/heathenhearted/,"Monster Hunter Wilds presents the next evolution of the long-running series and the first mainline title in the ninth generation of consoles. With Wilds, Capcom truly capitalizes on the concepts they explored with the Guiding Lands in Iceborne and refines the gameplay loop accordingly.

After completing the lengthy introductory campaign, players are free to roam the sprawling open zones of the Forbidden Lands and hunt dynamically spawning monsters seamlessly and without interruption. Old frustrations like the need to eat and apply buffs between every single hunt have been smoothed out and now operate on independent timers than only tick down when you're in the field. The end result of all this is that downtime has been reduced and you spend more time doing what is on the tin, hunting monsters.

Combat is at the most fluid and accessible it has ever been. Every weapon features refinements and exciting changes from past iterations, and the new wound system allows you to constantly keep up the aggression and smoothly target your attacks against exciting new opponents as well as old favorites.

Praise aside, there are few areas of Wilds that give me pause. Starting with World, Monster Hunter has attempted to broaden its mainstream appeal by introducing a greater emphasis on cinematic storytelling. This is pushed even further here, featuring the first voiced protagonist in the series as well as a cast of traveling companions and a storyline revolving around returning a lost orphan to his home, while protecting it from the threats (surprise, they're monsters) that face it.

To put it bluntly, none of this is particularly interesting. The characters are mostly a series of simple archetypes without any real development or investment and the broad strokes of the story hint at more interesting themes than this series is capable of meaningfully exploring. It's mostly serviceable, but that begs the question of whether it was worth including at all.

Beyond the narrative purpose, the story functions as an extended tutorial as wider gameplay concepts and tools are drip fed to the player in between extended sections of walking and talking along a set path. As it stands, the story and cinematics continue to serve as an impediment to those looking to jump into multiplayer, a problem that was introduced in World and is frustratingly unaddressed here. Overall, the emphasis Wilds places on narrative doesn't seem like it will win over anyone skeptical of the series, and it seems disconnected from the reasons people play these games in the first place. That said, recent statements from Capcom has them attributing much of the games success to it, so it will likely only progress further from here. Twenty hours is a not a great deal of time compared to the hundreds of hours of gameplay Wilds potentially offers, but it is certainly a rough way to start.

In addition to the story, recent titles in the Monster Hunter series (long considered dense and unapproachable to newcomers) have seen a push towards becoming more approachable. In Wilds, this is pushed to such an extent that it feels like every edge this series once had has been sanded off.

I can't help but feel that something has been lost in this transition. The once meditative atmosphere of entering a hunt and tracking down your target has been replaced with a mounted autopilot sprint to the monster which soon lies dead at your feet in a matter of minutes as a result of undertuned difficulty. Encounter design has not kept up with the expanding options afforded to the player. You are given tons of combat techniques but very little reason to master them. You are given tons of tools and an alternate weapon but don't really need to use them. You are given huge maps to explore but no reason to learn them. The element of preparing for hunts no longer exists since the nearest camp is always a stone's throw away where you change your load-out and refill all of your supplies which the game throws at you in piles. In the push towards sanitizing some of the frustrations in Monster Hunter's systems, some of its identity has also been lost.

I've played this series since the original entry in 2004. I adore these games, and firmly believe they fill a singular niche in the gaming landscape. I don't regret firing up Monster Hunter Wilds alongside the other rabid fans on launch day, nor the nearly one-hundred hours I've spent slicing and dicing my way across the Forbidden Lands since. The satisfaction of slaying dragons and using their bones to fight stronger dragons is here and as potent as ever. Yet, for the first time I find myself wishing to return to one of the earlier titles and their slower pace instead of continuing to bash nearly defenseless monster piñatas for more pieces and rewards in the current era. Even recent titles like World or Rise have me looking back with nostalgia.

Some of my thoughts here may seem overly critical, but with experience in this series comes the knowledge that these games start off good, but become something truly special over time with expansions and post-launch support. The first title update has already addressed some of the initial worries present at launch, and I have confidence there will be many more exciting additions and excitement to come, even if I might delay my experiencing of them as I play older titles that are more in line with my personal tastes. At the end of the day, any Monster Hunter is good Monster Hunter, and if you have any interest in the series, you'd be remiss to not try Wilds.",Recommended,4622,99.9 hrs on record,Posted: April 9

I started the series with World back in 2018 and spent over 250 hours on it (I didn't play Rise). Now with Wilds, I really fell into the game… I'm having a blast.

Absolute cinema
Finally my character speaks and is fully dubbed in my native language. Huge thumbs up to Capcom for that !

Wilds is the perfect entry point for anyone new to the Monster Hunter series. Monster Hunter World was great for beginners but Wilds does it even better. Some players might say Wilds is easier, yes, but the endgame monsters still offer a slight challenge.
The grind isn’t huge compared to other entries.
I enjoyed the story, even if it’s not that big.

The environments feel truly alive and are beautifully crafted, which makes the game immersive. Seikret mount is an interesting addition to Wilds, the last maps have so many vertical layers, but with the mount, it’s much faster to explore or chase monsters.

The Monster Hunter Wilds OST is just perfect. After hundreds of multiplayer sessions, I haven’t had so many issues so far.


Like every Capcom release, Wilds is unoptimized. Many players are struggling with poor performance and I really hope Capcom will do something about it in a future patches.

It’s 2025 and we’re paying €70 for a game and we need pay to just to edit your character’s appearance... It was the same for World and other Capcom titles but it’s still awful.

As a veteran from Monster Hunter World and Rise, I have found that Wilds has earned its place among the Monster Hunter Franchise. Wilds have a variety of weapon adjustments giving a new feel to the game. The weapon switch on your Seikret is a cool new gimmick that gives you the option to use Aliments as well as your main damage. The proof of power with the Great Sword has definitely been dropped off the TCS however we have been given a large improvement in movement. This is also worked out with a lot of the more ‘Clunky’ weapons and gives more ability to move. The ‘Focus Mode’ is an impressive way to utilise weak points more than just equipping ‘Weakness Exploit’ and has a VERY stylish finish. The ability to create your very own weapons was an incredible take on trying something new, the parts were locked behind RNG and gives a new way to create your builds.

alluringLuckycharm,https://steamcommunity.com/id/alluringLuckycharm/,"The combo loop in a hunt feels so much better. No clutch claw to break your flow of combos, No Wirebug cooldowns to think about for your certain big moves and mobility for every weapon class. Just some good ol' Focus Mode to keep you close to the boss so you can open wounds and exploit it. Decos feel much easier to farm for now, but the RNG still remains so that would keep the longetivity of the grind up still. Same way with how Artian weapons look, though I just hope to see Layered Weapons being a thing in the future since I very much enjoy how the modular weapon system works.

The map feels wonderful to explore as it always looks pretty and interesting, even if it's not always lush as the Plenty because it can be rather cool in the Fallow/Inclemency periods. Even choosing a hunt in the field feels rather satisfying, especially since you can hop in to another one after the being done with the previous. Best part is that they get put in the field history list so you can save it as an investigation and repeat it!

The stickers custom text's potential is so funny, it gets tempting to get more stickers for the fun of it!

The way Layered Armor works now, and the way the armor is now not genderlocked is WONDERFUL for people caring about customization, and not to mention it paves way of grinding the monsters that are easy to have a purpose aside from just having a checkmark that you're done with them. Just craft the HR armor and you straight up get the layered armor version of it! Especially since the armor design even from early on looks wonderful! I love my Musketeer look from Quematrice! I love the glamorous armor from Lala Barina! The classic Rathalos Armor! The eldritch look from Nu Udra's set! Even just the initial Hope armor set looks wonderful that it's fun to mix and match with others. Even the addition of undershirts and tights are a pretty nice option for further customizing the look for the armor set!

The story was enjoyable on the lens of someone who didn't have much high expectations for MH story. It has at least been better than World and trying to fix whatever dumb things the World Handler starts. MH Wilds story also introduces you to a satisfaction of hearing Alma tell you that you have authorization to hunt. The way they focus on the whole place's ecosystem is always their strong point, but the way it's done in Wilds is much interesting. It's not too amazing of a story, but it's a nice one nonetheless. Only problem for me is the railroading..

A couple of criticisms though :
Performance complaints are all valid, texture/model streaming is a glaring issue and the fact that the game demands a rather decent specs just to actually see the game clearly is sad. I also very very much would like to have a better anti-alias option than having to deal with upscaler's native AA or TAA (ew)

Please bring Monsters more tools against the Hunter! It feels like Tremors are barely an issue now and so is Wind Pressure. I only ever felt Tremors against Gravios and it feels like Wind Pressure either feels like it's not affecting us or it's actually just not there especially for Rathalos and Rathian. Not to mention, please let Hunters get interrupted during mid-focus strike wound break animation. Doesn't make sense to have hyperarmor throughout it and not get affected by crowd control effects like roars. We already have such a good time with the new focus mode system, I think it's best to dial it back down to move some of the power back to the monsters.

Open World doesn't feel like open world. It still feels the same as it was in World, except Field hunts are better rewarded. There's no incentive to actually treat the game as an open world map since the transition points are barely emphasized nor are they convenient to use. Map usage is also still split between regions so they barely feel connected once you're done with LR story, which is the only time you actually get to see and feel the open world connectivity.",Recommended,3269,100.4 hrs on record,Posted: March 9

At the end of the day, it's still Monster Hunter and it's a game I believe everyone should try to experience.

That being said, as good as the game is, it makes the bad aspects stand out even more. Performance issues aside, the on-rails sections of the story campaign, and the system for the story for that matter, really kill the pace of the game and are an antithesis to the addicting gameplay loop Monster Hunter fans love.

The UI is an absolute mess. The worst offender to this is the equipment menus (crafting and equipping). I would appreciate it if Capcom just kept a consistent menu design like they did from Gen 1-4. The network menus are hardly better, it's a pain to even play with friends which is one of the main reasons why people purchased this game in the first place.

All things aside, I would still recommend Monster Hunter Wilds, especially when it goes on sale, as the amount of time you will spend on it will be worth the price for the game. However, as it stands at launch, I can only barely recommend the game because of these glaring shortcomings in an otherwise fun game. I really wish I could recommend this game more, but with performance issues on PC and some bad UI choices that are a step back from previous installments of the game, I really can't.",Recommended,1228,162.3 hrs on record,Posted: March 3

The combat feels smoother than ever, focus mode being a huge reason for that. The new monsters in the cast are all excellent additions to the growing monster hunter roster, and returning monsters are all very beautiful, and some have had major glow ups from previous installments. The weapons and armor sets are unique and very well put together. The zones are stunningly beautiful, so much so that I often can't decide which one is my favorite, just opting to say whatever one I'm currently in is my favorite.

The story is nothing to write home about, but it is one of the better monster hunter stories, with a narrative through line that I didn't mind.

The new camp system doesn't make the most sense in the world, allowing for temporary camps that can be destroyed by monsters. And coming across hoards of three or more monsters, while cool in the world, has me going just why, especially since the game hands you dung pods to get rid of all but your target anyways. The multiplayer lobbies continue to be questionable.

Weird that I had to upgrade to 4 times the recommended system specs for the game to run smooth. Still a lot of optimization required. But now I can say that the game is actually fun to play. For my first Monter Hunter, I'm hooked!

Update: got one of the new RX 9070 XT graphics cards. Still kept crashing. Apparently the game crashes when the committed ram is full, not when the ""in use"" RAM is full. And MHW uses up to 38GB with spikes to 40. 32GB is not enough apparently. Configured my swap file to be 32GB max. as well and I don't crash anymore. Runs fine now on ultra settings, but some assets like the tutorial videos and armor/weapon icons cause hiccups and look weird for a moment. Capcom, please fix!

i've played MH games since TRI, and went back and replayed through earlier games after discovering the series.

this is the best iteration so far, with tons of QoL features. some OG fans may miss some of the hunter larping, but I sure don't.

the only notable mismatch from expectations was that the main story quest is way more on-the-rails than expected given the seemingly ""open world"" marketing. but end-game it opens up quite a bit.

Pros:
+ Plays similar to MHW in the case that it's open world enough to where you can explore the vast terrain
+ It is literally open world; although unless your set up is actually capable of handling the graphics, good luck on trying to enjoy the game to it's fullest
+ Hunter Arts/Rage Arts are still well implemented into each weapon and more moves implemented
+ Weapons that have a blocking mechanic now allows you to struggle with monsters if timed correctly
+ The game's difficulty goes from hand holding for the first portion of the game to ""Alright champ, time to go down hill at full speed"" once you get to the 5th monster
+ The story is compelling if that's something you go for. Personally in Monster Hunter games I'm in it for the hunt. I don't mind a story, just wish it wasn't so drawn out.

Considering this is my first Monster Hunter game where I actually played through the whole game, it is an extremely well made game with a lot of obvious care poured into it. (not to say the others are bad,) this is a very new player friendly addition to the series, with things for new and old players to enjoy alike.

The updated combat is refreshing but familiar, with new twists on beloved mechanics, with very little room to complain when it comes to how weapons feel and how acquiring new gear feels as well.

The monsters are all relatively fun to fight and well balanced, (aside from a few exceptions for certain attacks but I'm getting ahead of myself lol.) They all have very good designs and the changes/updates to them are refreshing and unique, the changes made really makes the world feel unique.

And speaking of unique, the story! The story is a very interesting and in depth tale on the Forbidden Lands, a previously unexplored area in the MH franchise, which makes the game that much more exciting. Without spoiling anything, the story alone is something everyone can enjoy, with a fresh take on the Monster Hunter combat and equipment systems MH fans have come to love over the years.

Optimization aside, this game is worth the price tag. (Even if I'm unsure I would personally spend that much money on it, I received it as a gift from a friend.) The story and combat flow exceptionally well together, the game's visual and sound design are even better than the predecessors which is saying something considering how beloved the previous games are, and the mechanics are tailored in a way that can cater to new and old players alike, breeding familiarity and ease of use to well known and new mechanics to the franchise alike.

If you're a fan of games that feature story and combat rich experiences, Monster Hunter Wilds for you. Whether it's pulling off devastating combos with powerful weapons, upgrading and maximizing your gear's potential, or slaying powerful and monstrous beasts with the love and care you forged into your arsenal, this game has everything for fans of the genre.

This game receives an overall Pineapple Score of a 9/10. With certain systems being a little difficult to get use to, and the online play still being rough compared to other games of the genre, it's still a massive leap in the franchise, and only makes me want to revisit the rest of the games even more.",Recommended,2021,132.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 6

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046195526/,"I would definitely recommend the game, there are some key features that has changed from the two previous titles that improves the flow of the hunts significantly and there is put a lot more attention to adding minor, but meaningful systems for the overall experience.

Performance
I cannot tell you that it performs well on all hardware, but for my 3080 + i9 13900 setup, it runs seamlessly at high graphics (stationary setup, laptops with same or similar specs are not comparable due to thermals protections built into the laptop specific models).

Combat
I am a gameplay first kind of person, where a game that feels good triumphs any AAA game title that lacks gameplay, but has hyper realistic graphics. I had recently played both Rise and World,
I prefer Worlds combat premise, but feel that Rise has a better tempo while being a bit chaotic due to the vast mobility options built into the design of combat. Wilds strike a perfect balance between these two. It has the calm and calculated combat of worlds, that is more recognizable with the franchise as a whole, with slight increase in the tempo, but not as fast as Rise. The Afflicted system of Rise that brought a lot more variety to the gameplay got ported to the wound system, which in turn makes the monsters more responsive to the hunter's attacks, but also changes up the gameplay flow of just hitting the weak spots.

Attention to detail
Travel time with the Seikret, areas, loading times and lack thereof (a lot more is dynamically loaded), good looking armor detailing, meaningful dual weapon system that inherently also allows for more variation during a hunt, much better controls for keyboard and mouse (anyone who has played Rise/World and swapped between playing melee and ranged will agree), cooking animation, village life, brief cut scenes (a lot more in-world story vs. prerendered cutscenes now too) and the best area of improvement:

Anyone who has played Worlds can Rise can agree that playing multiplayer before the endgame is a task as you can join at very specific times during the mission, which might be several minutes in and you would have to repeat it for every friend you play with to progress their story. Rise had minor improvements in this regard by lowering the overall time it took to arrive at the monster you are meant to hunt, but none-the-less a task.
I had not even seen this advertised for Wilds, . If you and your buddy join a link team, each of you then start the current story mission, you will still have to go through the initial dialog and cut scenes, but when you both get to the monster, you can just join the other person and after killing the monster, it will progress both your stories! I cannot tell how much this matters for a great experience in the game with friends, especially when you are introducing new people to the game.
Another great feature of the game is also now the open world hunts and the environment link system, allowing all zones to act as the Guiding Lands from Worlds, where you can seamlessly go from target to target with your friends to practice, test builds and get parts.

Improvements to the combat responsiveness and variation due to wound system in combination with the new multiplayer systems are more than sufficient for a person like me to recommend the game at the price it is at.",Recommended,2755,131.6 hrs on record,Posted: March 4

While this may come down to personal preference, Monster Hunter Wilds feels somewhat undercooked compared to World and Rise.

That said, I find its gameplay loop more engaging than Rise, though it still seems to lack something that made World special. Perhaps this is because World was my entry point into the series, making its gameplay feel more familiar and refined to me.

I also gave Rise a fair shot, first on Switch and later on PC, but my impressions remained the same. In terms of overall polish and content completion, Rise feels more complete than Wilds.

szabolcs_42,https://steamcommunity.com/id/szabolcs_42/,"This is my first ever mh game (except maybe like 3 hours in mh worlds) and here is my honest opinion so far.

-Gameplay is fu*king fire. Best it has ever been from what I hear from some of my veteran friends. It's slow but fluid and not too difficult to get into once you get the hang of it. People complaining about the game being too easy are either stupid or too experienced for their own good. I find the game's difficulty just right as a new player. It's not that difficult to die if you don't pay attention even against low rank monsters and I'm saying this after having put hundreds of hours into even more difficult games like Elden Ring.

-Party content is a bit cluncky in my opinion. The menu and the UI is not what I would call intuitive and it took me a few hours to figure out how it works and how to party up. BUT it does work and after getting used to it I'm starting to see how it works and it's not that bad. We have seen worse in other new games recently even UI wise and functionality wise aswell, sadly. Still, I believe the devs need to address this and streamline the experience A LOT. In 2025 I shouldn't need to add my friend, invite him to a link, invite him to my environment, and invite him to a hunt after just to be able to play together. Jumping through all these hoops feels tiring and unneccessary. I should just be able to invite and go like it's done in other games.

-Performance fu*king sucks ass. For this reason alone I advise everyone thinking about buying the game to hold off for a few months at least (or few weeks, depending on how soon the devs realize that this can not stand). I have a lower high-end pc with a Ryzen 5 7600 and a RX 7800 XT with 32 gigs of ram and the game is on an nvme ssd and with native fsr, high graphics (not even ultra), without ray tracing, in 1080p I'm getting 50-80 fps depending on the environment. Yes, I could lower the graphics but the game has like PS3 graphics as is, so I'm just not gonna do that and people with mid tier or lower pc specs would not have a fun time with this game 100%. Devs need to fix this asap.

Conclusion: If you have a high-end pc, invest, and if you don't, then hold off for now. If the devs fix the performance this WILL be goty. Ty for reading, have a nice day :)",Recommended,1829,101.2 hrs on record,Posted: March 4

Tiredkiwi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tiredkiwi/,"Update after first title update:
The game now runs lot more better and i can play again!
Multiplayer lags sometimes but that's very likely due to the servers being overloaded.

Few things i would like to share is:
When i first updated the game my game did not run well i verified files ect, not sure what happened but i reinstalled and that seemed to fix the issue.
The game crashing upon launch with the crash code being fatal d3d error, i fixed it by disabling steam overlay and incase made the game administrator which solved the crash issue of that error for me.
Also turned on frame generation which made it lot smoother (it made game lag more before update and patch for me now it does the opposite yipeee!)

I will however say that what happened and the state of how it was released was not acceptable in any way, i hope in the future they will take their time to polish and release their game when it is ready i think people rather wait longer and get a polished amazing game than wait short time and get the opposite.

I hope the things i did will help others as well and that everybody may hunt and enjoy amazing meals as well!

Character creation is quite decent and satisfying . Expect to spend a lot of time in it . Just do not expect big boob sliders .

The maps are pretty open and Filled with Life . Really gives the feel of a living world .

Armor sets are fairly nice to and I will say its very nice touch to give off some fashion vibes .

Cons :

Character Vouchers is nothing new to the franchise so expect to pay real money to change your major looks .



Launch was released with bad optimization which is quite sad due to the fact a mod author has already found a way to fix this issue on day one in less than 24 hours where the Game developers failed to do so within the beta to full release period . I do not understand what is wrong with game developers these days .

Co op in these types of games is way too complex than it needs to be . Do not expect to enjoy co op fully till endgame .

This is my most negative experience and con : Only read this next section if you like to read annoying ranting .





Everything else in the game works fair and It really is a enjoyable game . I am pretty sure The developers will get their patches out soon hopefully . However I have not finished the game yet and It does feel good to play .
The game has some flaws but it is worth the time and it is not near as perfect as I expected . Not certain if its worth $70 base game I still feel it should be 59.99 with how much their going to profit off the microtransactions but then again I bought this game for 109.99 . I will say this It is worth it to me due to my interest in the game . Others might see differently .",Recommended,1472,80.6 hrs on record,Posted: March 2

Zheiss,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Zheiss/,"Pardon the playtime, I was playing offline most of the time. I wish there's a mixed recommendation button since while this game is an absolute blast, it has a very noticeable issue that Capcom might not be able to fix at all. I am a fellow hunter since 2011 that started with MHP3rd and I have to say, it is pretty awesome to see this franchise grow from just a game with a niche handheld portable community within Asia to launching a new game that has over a 1.3 million concurrent players just on Steam alone and in less than 24 hours to boot.

Though it is kind of sad that veterans would have to wait for the challenging monsters to be added. World and Rise gave me a bit of a challenge early game but with Wilds, I am just breezing through every monster they introduce but that comes with trying to cater to a massive playerbase and the more people that play this franchise, the better.

Now the negative? The optimization. This game does not look and play like it should require Frame Generation just to get acceptable framerates and Capcom enabling it by default on supported hardware says it all. Given that this is Capcom's money maker, they should've pooled their resources, delayed the announcement and released this game on their newer engine REX.

RE Engine just isn't suited for open world game design and would require a significant rewrite to how the engine works at a core level for this game's performance to be fixed. Dragons Dogma 2 is proof of that and Capcom's developer conference confirms this. If they'd somehow, by miracle port the entire game to REX Engine while developing the expansion pack then that might fix this game's performance issues.

Overall, an evolution to the MH formula introduced in World and I can't wait to see what the future title updates we'll receive. I hope they bring back franchise crossovers again just like back in the Nintendo era. Those were pretty fun events.",Recommended,1582,96.3 hrs on record,Posted: February 28
IopishBuns,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IopishBuns/,"I love Monster Hunter, it's easily my favorite series, and I've played every playable entry in the series in my region, minimum a hundred hours in each title besides this one (so far!) I feel like I can speak from a place of experience, historical knowledge, and general authority when I say: This is one of the most confusing entries in the series.

Let's talk about the good, the bad, and my general thoughts on these things.

The Good































This looks like a lot of negative, but to be completely fair, a lot of what would go in positives is just...things already good about Monster Hunter. It feels like there's a lot of focus on players here for the loooong grind, and not on players just looking to dress up like the Chatacabra and swing a big hammer. It feels strangely easy to hit the cap on one weapon you love, but then so difficult to branch out. Without the home aspect ,without a hub, without a reason to grind besides Artians (Which again, are a trap) and decorations (Which nobody likes the grind for), and hoping to the gods above this Rathalos graces you with a Ruby (for 1/10th of an armor sphere). I'm just not sure what direction they wanted to go with a lot of the grind, and the exploration feels shallow despite the focus on it in trailers and dialogue.

Speaking of dialogue ,listen as a visual novel enjoyer, as a walking sim enjoyer, as a giant nerd that loves listening to characters speak, I need the characters in this game to shut up for ten seconds. It wouldn't be so bad if dialogue didn't stop you from pressing buttons and often force your camera - - but it's so frequent and so constant it genuinely began to make me hate the characters in this game. I also am deeply curious how any of these people aside from Astrum even functioned before we came along.

I also have to edit my review for a moment. I am regularly spending 30+ minutes trying to just connect to any hunt for one of the three monsters that even give worthwhile rewards. It is ridiculous that Monster Hunter is still *decades* behind its peers on online multiplayer. I understand what a difficult issue Multiplayer is on each unique engine, but the truth is, if RE Engine and the Monster Hunter team cannot come up with a better system than ""Several menus deep, connects one in every few dozen times"", they need to use a new engine or change something. I'd expect this kind of thing fro ma tiny team on a new property, but this is several massive companies working on a massive title. It is patently unacceptable.

I also don't like the change to decorations it makes it feel very weird for aggressive strategies but that might just be me.,

I hope we do more with because that's an insane thing to drop on us in this title and then do basically nothing with. Truly wild.

Anyway, is back and so is as a mechanic and narrative device so the game is perfect, 10/10, 5/5, just needs Zinogre and Gigginox now.",Recommended,2408,152.2 hrs on record,Posted: March 4

Easy Recommend.

3090ti, 12900k, 64gb DDR5. No performance issues at 1440p (consistent 80-90 fps with a few tweaks).

TLDR:

100% Achievements, 200+ Hours, HR 300+. Longtime veteran of the series (since MH1). It's awesome.

NOTE: I received the game for free, but I would have bought the maximum version anyway and it wouldn't have changed a single thought about the game.

Quick thoughts:

Awesome forward step for the MH franchise. Lots of rough edges smoothed out, great onboarding for newer players, and some really awesome weapon updates.

Is it easy? Every MH is ""easier"" if you've played a MH before. However, Wilds is a bit easier due to the AI of both the Palico and the Support Hunters being incredibly good. If you want something closer to the old school challenge, don't use the AI Hunters and bench your Palico. If you don't care, then play it how it is. It's fine either way. There's no wrong way to play it.

Enough people have gone into the nitty gritty of the game, so I'll just say that it's great. It's a strong first version and I'm very much looking forward to events and the eventual g-rank/master-rank update. If you know and love MH, you don't need a recommendation - you are going to play this anyway. If you've never played a MH before, or if you only dabbled and it didn't ""click"", then certainly give this one a try.

There are minor inconveniences, but compared to past MH games, they feel trivial. Different things will bother different people, so no point listing them here. There's so much good in this MH that it's a mega-easy recommend for both new and old players. Get it.

Asphe,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Asphe/,"... remember when Monster Hunter World was a monster to run on your system? Then you upgraded your CPU/GPU and... now it's the same thing all over again...

The minimum requirements shown means the downright minimum to get the game to run. The worst graphical quality at barely slideshow speed frame rates. The recommended requirements SHOULD give you a playable experience. Whether it's enjoyable or not, is up to the player.

If you are the type that ""must"" have 120 fps at 2160p with all the bells and whistles... go buy a new system with component releasing in 2027, then buy this game. If you are ok with 30~45 fps at 1440p with medium-high settings and some bells silent...

I'd recommend a minimum of a 4060 (with at least 8GB of vRAM, nothing less and no mobile versions either), a FAST SSD (or dual SSDs if you are not on M2 connectors), 32gb of system RAM (64 is better, doesn't seem to benefit from 96 or 128) AND much lowered expectations as regards to performance.

I really don't see how much future optimisations can improve performance that much (look at how much changed with Dragon's Dogma 2) - it's not just your GPU here.

The main issue is the game loading (and unloading) assets, i.e. poly models & textures, the shapes of stuff and the 'paint' that goes onto those shapes. This allows the game to let the player into the game quickly (instead of staring at a loading screen). The game also loads in low-poly shapes & low-res textures first (smaller and therefore faster to load in) then load in the high-poly shapes & high-res textures later. This is why you'll see ""ugly"" pop in first, then change to ""good"" later. This process relies on your CPU, hard drive, system RAM and associated sub-systems. Having a 5090 won't help much with this.

Devs made the decision to have high-poly, high-res textures for everything. You can mitigate this by dropping the polycount and the lowest-res textures. The smaller those are, the faster the game loads it in (asynchronous asset streaming). The texture compression used requires higher CPU workload and is quite slow (mainly due to the large sizes involved).

Personally, I'd rather just stare at a long loading screen.

Meanwhile, what you as a player can do is to reduce the size of the files involved as much as possible. Low-res textures, low-poly geometry as well as playing at a lower resolution / lower frame rate.

Devs... I appreciate you trying to reduce the install size - but I'd rather you use a FASTER texture compression method at the expense of larger file sizes on disk. Also you should tune each biome and KEEP certain assets loaded instead of constantly loading/unloading assets. I realise you intended to let the game fit on lesser hardware (i.e. consoles) but now, every player has to deal with stuttering and ugly pop-ins. WIlds DESERVES a 'Mixed' Steam review score because the performance issues are caused by your decision to forcefully fit your game towards an outdated hardware model while pushing graphical detail. At least, give players the choice to decompress textures on disk, let the game keep assets in memory or just load as much as possible at the beginning.

----------

Otherwise, yes it's a Monster Hunter game, it is as deep and rich an experience as MH Worlds. Probably a bit less challenging (if it follows MH Worlds, more challenging monster will be added later) and certainly not as challenging as Dauntless' behemoths (RIP May 2025). Graphics are as good or better (IF your system can handle it), audio is as good as always, the movement and combat mechanics are there but things are both a bit more simplified and less deep. The control / combat mechanics are easier to pickup / relearn and somewhat easier to master. This is the probably the easiest MH game to introduce newbies too. The learning curve is much more gradual and a lot less challenging at first.

Unfortunately, this means the weapons tend to be more similar to each other. e.g. unlike Worlds where a player would benefit from choosing the right weapon (and armor) for each monster... the gear in Wilds is a bit more generic. Pretty much every weapon is somewhat similar except for the element. Within the same rarity, weapons are not very different.

Story-wise... it's a Capcom story. It's there. You're not here for that, are you?

Probably the biggest change is the multiplayer system. It's a lot easier to meet up with strangers. Instead of a public, smol lobbies... you have much larger lobbies and can form pre-made lobbies and be a member of multiple mini-clans/guilds. The changes in combat mechanics also play into this, it's a bit more fun doing co-op and a LOT easier to get into a public instance. Unless your team (or you) just carts all the time. But... wouldn't it be easier to just make Wilds a MMO/MO? Just have something like the relay hubs in DE's Warframe.

This all boils down to the game just letting you get to the action constantly. You get to the 'fun' faster and more easily than any other game in the franchise. Unfortunately, this kinda means you end up with just the one or two armor sets and similar playstyles. Build variety should expand with upcoming DLC/expansions but this is on a PER weapon basis - there are over a dozen weapons. Simply put, this game is pretty much all main course, Capcom cut out almost all the chaff, greatly streamlined the experience even over Monster Hunter World to the point it feels significantly easier to veterans of the franchise. But it's still fun. It's more fun. This is the game you should use to introduce newbies to the franchise

A last note about the graphics, devs went whole hog on details. Again, IF your rig can support it, the graphical details far eclipse previous entries in the franchise. IF you can run it.

*Also if any ex-PHX Lab / Riot sees this - This game knows how to do Invert Axis. Perhaps the % of players who like this feature is smol... but it includes the nerds who are willing (and can afford) to buy flightsticks and pedals, 3rd party controllers and stuff like VR and eye trackers... the kind of players that are the most valuable to a free-to-play game. Just sayin'

You can alter the config.ini file outside the game enabling GPU configurations that let you hit 60fps @ 1440p with a 1070Ti. There should be mods for this in the usual places. It makes Wilds look as ""bad"" as World but more importantly... plays as fast. Or just do everything you can do lower texture resolution, polygons of any geometry in-game, rending distance and so on. You want to turn off certain bells and whistles but the biggest bottlenecks are texture resolution, polygon counts and frame rate. Lower any or all three and things are better.

Use something like ISLC (Intelligent Standby List Cleaner) - this isn't so much as increasing 'free RAM' as helping reduce memory fragmentation (Ubisoft's The Division series is great at causing crashes due to poor memory management) - you could cause Wilds to crash simply by paging apps in memory (including just repeatedly alt-tabbing or using a lot of tabs in a chromium browser with lots of videos running). YMMV but this does seem to help.

Change the CPU priority so Wilds has the highest priority (not really needed if your CPU is < 7 years old but seems to improve stability...)

A few other things too (ignoring all the cheats/nudes) - the game can run quite well if you lower the right settings and... your expections of high frame rates",Recommended,6183,281.8 hrs on record,Posted: March 2

Overall, very fun to play, and I am eagerly awaiting Title Updates. Some gripes here and there, but the main issue comes down to performance. My PC isn't top of the line, but its not terribly outdated either. The roster of monsters is small, but the new additions to the cast are all extremely memorable, and make me excited for events and MR versions of them. Status builds seem like the biggest winners, paralyze goes crazy this generation. Would recommend the game. Change to highly recommend if the multiplayer gets streamlined.

Pros:
Its Mon Hun. I can't put it any other way.
Weapon additions feel great. The easy shield charge on charge blade feels great (even if I still manage to get clobbered between charging phials and charging the shield). Played with someone running two hunting horns and the buffs made me feel like a god. They are the only random I have played with that made enough of an impact to remember from World through Rise through Wilds. Perfect Guard feels great to do, even when you miss the follow ups.
New monsters feel great. Honestly, every monster save one feels great to fight.
Focus mode makes aiming less clunky. There are arguments that having to line up shots was part of the fun, and they do have merit, but I still think this is better. You can't turn that fast (though perhaps it could be a little slower) and honestly I rarely ever missed because my aim was off, it was always because the monster suddenly backed up exactly one SAED length.
Wounds and focus attacks are a much better version of the clutch claw and tenderizing. Perhaps a little strong, but not so strong that they can't be accounted for by tweaking some numbers and/or diminishing returns.

Cons:
Gravios exists. Scientists have discovered that the Monster Hunter universe has no gods, because no gods would allow Gravios to exist.
Performance. The performance is, in a word, ass. My rig meets the recommended specs exactly, and I can say that they should have been the minimum. The game crashes a lot. The game stutters a lot. Capcom has never had great servers. All of things hurt Wilds, and the performance is easily the biggest downside.
Insect Glaive. I don't know what they did to it, but I wish they didn't do it. I can't even explain it, but it makes me viscerally sad.
Multiplayer. This was solved, man. Rise multiplayer works great. They could have just done that. Instead, we got a nightmarish mess of links and groups and parties and needing the konami code just because I wanted to jump a fire chicken with my pal. ""They pretty clearly didn't want you to play the story with other people."" I don't care what they wanted me to do. I care what I wanted me to do. And that was to have a dork in glasses authorize me and my mates to make someone from PETA have a heart attack.
Gravios still exists. I'm just as upset about it as you are.

The difficulty is fine. Many people are screaming and crying about difficulty. The difficulty is very similar to World. The overwhelmingly vast majority of people crying about difficulty killed Alatreon, Fatalis, Arch-Tempered Velkhana, and all the Risen Elders at Anomaly Rank 300 solo, and then decided they wanted to expect to cart in low rank and the beginning of high rank. That's not the opinion of a person worth taking seriously.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198079053909/,"If you like Monster Hunter World, then you'll probably like this. It's basically the same with a few new combat mechanics. I do have complaints though and that's what the rest of this review is gonna be so strap in! Also at the time of writing this I have just gotten to the credits and have not done any post story stuff yet. But I will be playing more because the gameplay is fun.

The Story
Now this is my opinion but holy bad writing batman this story sucks! The entire story revolves around one person and it isn't you. you are a side character here. the main character is a kid called Nata who got lost in the desert after his home was attacked by a monster. for about 80% of the story your just trying to return this kid home. I hate Nata, He annoys me, his dialog is bad and he's written badly. If you've played Borderlands 3, he's this games Ava. The story is basically, there's a monster acting weirdly, find out why. hunt it. The ending was very bad. I wont say too much because spoilers, but. It took a plot point that was established earlier on and threw it out the window just so it could have a scene with Nata being all ""aww, Things worked out in the end, yay :)."" seriously, the amount of time devoted to Nata in this story to try and make him look good and important is insane. Literally if he wasn't there the story wouldn't change. I found myself saying out loud multiple times ""Shut up Nata.""

Gameplay
It's Monster hunter. you fight monster with big over the top weapons. I like the new weapon mechanics with the breaking wounds on monsters. I still prefer Rise over this. but I enjoyed the combat much more here than I did in World. The Monster designs are cool. Only issue I have is that there isn't really a main hub, this game being more open world'ish makes it so there's like a mini hub in each area. BIG MASSIVE ISSUE though, as far as I can tell, there are no funny cats cooking food cutscenes. you cook the food yourself on a portable bbq grill thing. This is an outrage and I almost didn't recommend this game because of that. How dare they leave out the funny cooking cats!

Performance/Graphics
It's bad. despite this game looking like it belongs on the PS3. I struggle to hit 50 fps during a fight on medium settings. My PC isn't bad either. the textures looks absolutely terrible. some of the textures on clothes could have come straight from the PS2. I even downloaded the 70GB HD texture pack to see if there was any difference. it looked the exact same. seriously all the graphic settings look the same. The only thing that changed was my FPS.

Conclusion
It's a Monster hunter game. despite my issues with the game. I still enjoyed it. Rise is still my favourite, but this game is good too. If you liked World, you'll like this. you just have to get past the incredibly bad and boring story first. I'm recommending this game because I've never thought the story in Monster Hunter games were too important. The performance is a big issue but in general it was playable. And while the graphics have somehow ended up looking worse than World and Rise, at least the gameplay was fun and that's what matters to me more. Even though textures do look incredible lazy, I would almost think they were placeholders for the actual textures.",Recommended,2673,24.0 hrs on record,Posted: March 3
Honorablejapanesechef,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Honorablejapanesechef/,"Wilds is amazing, but in a rough state right now.

First of all, Wilds is probably the peak of Monster Hunter gameplay. All the monsters are distinct and unique and is one of the better base game rosters in the series. The new combat is fantastic, mainly due to the focus mode and wound system. All the weapons feel great and also look great. Unlike World where every weapon/armor set was made of bones and feathers, in Wilds every set is distinct and looks awesome.
The story is actually interesting this time (even if it's too on rails and theres too much space between hunts), but the co-op systems for the story are still terrible which is really sad given how they got it right in Rise. The graphics are also decent, but only if you install the High Res Texture Pack DLC. The textures that ship with the game look terrible.

Wilds is very close to being the perfect Monster Hunter game, the only thing that sucks is the performance. The game is extremely demanding, and it doesn't even look good enough to justify how bad it runs. With the default textures it looks only slightly better than World did. This is clearly an issue with RE Engine, which just can't handle open world games that well. The benchmark also does very little to give you a good idea on how it actually runs.

That said, I also think a lot of people are over hyping how bad the game runs. There are so many dorks out there that complain about the performance but then REFUSE to use DLSS and Frame Gen because they think an extra 1/10th of a second of input lag is going to ruin their experience when statistically, 99% of people won't even notice it.
I agree that we shouldn't need DLSS and Frame Gen for games to work properly, but that's where we are. So your options are either use DLSS and Frame Gen or don't play the game because the performance likely won't get any better.

Overall, amazing game as long as your PC can handle it. If you have a 30, 40 or 50 series card you should be fine, otherwise you're probably better off with the slightly more optimized console version.",Recommended,1686,47.2 hrs on record,Posted: March 1

However I would consider this a cautious recommend, It requires a fairly modern CPU (I.E last 4 generations) and you will need to turn settings down... this is not a 4k title and I do not recommend playing it at that, 4K gaming has never been very good performance in general.

Yes, the game will be harsh depending on your pc configuration, just like Alan Wake 2 was. So unless your pc is top tier, don't download the high texture pack, that's about it.

Yes, it's also insanely fun, with an engaging plot and a fantastic open world experience.

leafdreamer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/leafdreamer/,"This is my first MH game so my experience is not tied to previous entries.

I really enjoyed my experience through the Low and High Rank story segments. The character creator is really, really good, and I liked pretty much every character from the main cast. The story, which I've been told is usually not the forefront of the franchise, is quite gripping and easy enough to follow. The various monster designs are really cool and unique, each hunt feels special. The soundtrack is phenomenal, I don't get sick of the normal hunt themes in each region, and the Apex themes, especially Rey Dau's and Uth Duna's, are superb.

I've only properly messed around with one weapon (Light Bowgun) and it's an absolute blast to play with, popping wounds in one explosive fell swoop from range is so satisfying. I played through most of the game alone, without SOS Flares, but the multiplayer experience is also unlike anything else in a very positive way, plus it made some of the trickier hunts that I replayed later, like the Black Flame, way more fun by not having the monster constantly focusing fire on me the entire time.

At this point in time, the reviews for this game are flooded with mentions of performance issues, but I personally didn't experience too many of them. That said, I do have a pretty strong PC and I play on High settings, without the High Res Texture Pack. I only had one hiccup during the intro cutscene and a few during some Rathian hunts in the Scarlet Forest when I tried the game on Ultra settings.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198847053801/,"MH Wilds a game that gives more good than bad. Thats what you can expect from every monster hunter games is some sort of surprise. It always innovates and elevates its predecessor. It gives new ground rules and injects some mark on itself. Most noticeable are new gameplay systems that helps to provide more engaging and fun gameplay.

And this one is a special one oh yes it is. Now im just a simpler gamer that enjoys everything this franchise presents on the table but I can tell you this is one of the best experience I’e got since MH Rise. Now forget clunky clumsy World experience that is waste of your time because Wilds shatters everything and raises the new bar of quality of life.

The key word is fun gameplay and that’s what you will get here. Every monster encounter is special and personal. There are a lot of new species and wild lands that look phenomenal in day time. Everything is a living world and never stops breathing and evolving. You feel like a part of this biosphere. Day night cycle and everchanging weather mechanics keeps every loop of a gameplay tight and fresh. Your newly raised mount help to traverse into harshes lands and spots. Very easy and I say best version of collecting meterials on a fly and meeting your main goal. Nothing stops unless you want to stop it just goes and goes.

Now after Rise wire bug I couldn’t imagined myself playing other MH game fun like that but I was wrong because new wound system made everything more deadly and on point. Focuse mode made life easier and live changing experience. Now I can swoop and whoop between monster attacks without worrying to much dying because everything is based on skill and precision. Wound system made so much more enjoyable Dual Blades that I can feel like im dancing on battlefield instead of running from danger. It’s one of the best versions of the mechanics.

New monsters gave new life to this game and made it more colourful. I just wished there were more of them. So if you a new comer I would suggest to wait at least until expansion comes out in that way you will have the full throtell no stop experience and you don’t have to wait for more content on a line.

Lastly its been a joy to serve my battles with my Red Panda Palico. It became closer than ever in our journey that this Palico is a full fledged warrior.

ruvaakh,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ruvaakh/,"For context, I’ve played most of the MH games, so I have solid experience with the series. I’ll mainly compare Wilds to World/Iceborne for obvious reasons. And I didn't experienced any major bug, only minors ones.

---

The positive side.

The level of detail in Wilds is absolutely stunning. From the way monsters interact with their environment to the lifelike animations of NPCs and even our own character’s movement. The dynamic weather systems, the way wildlife behaves naturally, and the subtle details in the world make it feel truly alive. It’s clear a lot of love and effort went into building this ecosystem.

The AI improvements are another big highlight. Playing with AI Hunters feels surprisingly natural, they’re actually competent and react well in combat. However, I do wish there was a way to letting them know we want to capture a monster rather than killing it outright.

The combat is nicer than ever. Despite my issues with the wound system, the flow of battle feels fantastic. Yet, I have some remarks (see below).

And, as usual, Capcom has outdone themselves with the soundtrack.

I like the dynamics between NPCs (returning ones !), the variety of personalities, and the small side quests. It made the world feel more engaging.

As for the main story, I just wish there were more tense moments. We know the Hunter is too badass to be truly taken down. In World, our character had moments of weakness, taking blows or just struggling. It made them more relatable, while still maintaining the status of being THE Hunter.

Wilds has some nice throwback lore and ties a little bit the in-universe lore but still keep some mysteries. I appreciated that we get the occasional glimpse into the Hunter’s past through scattered fragments (and we need more of that).

---

The negative side.

My biggest issues with the game is that it takes away the feeling of being a hunter. Now, it feels more like Monster Fighter than Monster Hunter. Capcom has done an incredible job with Wilds’ world-building, but ironically, we barely interact with it. The sense of learning and memorising it has been replaced by automation, making the hunting experience feel passive rather than immersive.

I have a love-hate relationship with Seikret 'Scoutflies 2.0"". They automates too much of the experience, turning hunts into following a GPS instead of tracking your prey. Yes, you can switch Seikret to manual mode, but that’s not the issue. The issue is that whatever the mode, you still see all the monsters showing on your map. The game itself is designed to guide you rather than let you lead, and that’s what takes away the sense of discovery.

In MHW/MHWI, tracking was an actual part of the hunt. You had to gather enough clues before you could pinpoint a monster’s location. The Scoutflies helped, but they didn’t just magically know where the monster was. They required player effort first, since monsters didn’t even appear on your map. And even then, they weren’t 100% reliable, sometimes leading you the wrong way. It was frustrating, sure, but it added to the feeling of exploration.

In older MH, we had items to help, but their effects were temporary. Sometimes, Chacha/Kayamba would point you in the right direction. Or, if you were experienced enough, you simply memorised monster patterns or items locations.

Iceborne introduced mounts, but it was a late addition and couldn’t take shortcuts, so you still had to learn the map to go quicker. Rise had the Palamute, but you had to navigate yourself. I actually like having Mounts. But they shouldn’t streamline the hunting experience so much that it removes the challenge of learning the world and tracking your prey. Instead of making it more engaging, Capcom has cut that aspect entirely.

The second issue for me is with the wound system. I’m having a great time with the combat, but I feel like the wound system makes fights way too easy. The monsters themselves aren’t badly designed. In fact, the fights are dynamic, fun and very visual.

For those who thought wall slams in Iceborne were overpowered, the wound system in Wilds is worse. It’s almost a guaranteed flinch or knockdown. Depending on your weapon, the monster will stop mid-attack, allowing you to land a focus strike, and only then does it flinch or fall. At least with wall slams, you couldn’t spam them constantly, they depended on some conditions, and sometimes failed because of the wrong item (we’ve all been there 😂). Once a monster was enraged, it would ignore attempts entirely. Yes, wounds can’t reappear on the same body part twice, but monsters have so many woundable spots that it sometimes lock the monster out of the fight. This, combined with the insane build up of para..

Another issue I’m struggling with is the rework of the deco system. We don't have the freedom of choice anymore and are now split between weapon and armour slots. I get that this is likely to prevent stacking the same jewels everywhere, it just feels restrictive. Depending on your weapon pairing, you might have a good fit for one weapon but not the other. It takes away some of the experimentation that made making builds enjoyable. On top of that, some skills feel pointless, or at least, I can’t see their practical use (i.e Cliffhanger).

Now, the UI. How we did end up like this ? I really wish there was an option to mute the constant flow of notifications, or at the least, be non-interactive since we can’t do anything until they stop popping up. The item pouch full warning is annoying. Why they just send it to the stash ? We are still have with the same issue World had at launch. It’s funny how QoL from older games just vanish.

I play Iceborne while waiting for the TU, and something has me brainscrambled. For some reason, browsing/using items or sheathing is way faster in MHI than Wilds. Can't recall if that was the case with base World.

Multiplayer is also overcomplicated, with different party instances that make co-op more confusing than it should be. I’m not a game developer, but If MMOs can sync players in massive worlds, can’t we just go out and sync everyone to the leader’s game automatically ? Thus skipping an extra step. Most people sit in their squad lobbies to play with friends or search for SOS Flare quests.

---

I really want to love Wilds. In many ways, I do, and I will continue to play it. The game is visually stunning, the combat feels fluid, and the world is rich with detail. But at the same time, I can’t shake the feeling that something is missing. It streamlined some aspects (hunting), but overcomplicated others (UI, multiplayer). Sadly, it sometimes feels like the team spent so much time making the world feel alive that they overlooked some of the core gameplay elements. The story feels a bit uneven, with the first half being enjoyable, but the second lacking impact and not coming together.

Putting that aside, at only 40 hours in, I’m feeling a bit bored, not from hunting, but just there is not enough challenge, even at 7-8* monsters and I don't have a finished build. I can’t recall feeling this way with World’s base game or older.

If I had to recommand the game, just come back in a few months, when the game is patched and have some TU behind.",Recommended,6013,133.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 11

vallinek,https://steamcommunity.com/id/vallinek/,"It's more of the same Monster Hunter goodness, with the open world only meaning the camps physically exist on the maps, and your handler actually hangs around close to you, letting you start quests anywhere you want. Presentation is top notch as always, and pummeling monsters is as fun as ever.

There is a few big issues though:
Optimization - while there is an improvement from the beta, my guess is the game trying to run on not one but two layers of DRM (Denuvo + Capcom's homemade DRM) ends up hogging all the resources. While it is playable, it will not be a smooth experience.
The other issue is focus mode and all of the related mechanics, causing everyone to call Wilds ""too easy"" - basically it allows you to turn during your attacks, meaning savvy players generally will not be whiffing their attacks when they normally would have due to being a bit off. I wouldn't say it's the primary issue here though, as it's the wounds and focus strikes that impact it the most - basically attacking a part softens it and highlights it in red when in focus mode, and doing a focus strike on it will force stagger the monster while doing a free autocombo for damage, and in case of some weapons do extra bonuses. (LS gains a free spirit level, CB goes into pizza cutter mode, IG gets all the extracts etc.) The problem is that if your damage is high enough you can pretty much just keep a monster stunlocked for a lot of the fight. (Offsets and power clashes are mostly fine, though I wish the player had more input on them to where they weren't just auto-wins if timed correctly.)

Overall, the experience is still good, just with some caveats. It is probably the most beginner-friendly of the bunch given all the new features, though with a need for a balance pass to adjust the game's challenge.",Recommended,1476,93.4 hrs on record,Posted: March 16

SnSfp,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SnSfp/,"Review made on release build with 76 hours of game time

Story: 3/10
This story just doesn't make any sense. I am extremely disappointed by the storytelling as Capcom hyped me up to believe that this would be THE monster hunter to finally have a good story... yet I am left here thinking that there was so much missing potential. The sid characters had some personality but it did not feel like that impacted the story in any way... it felt like they only served to become likable rather than purposeful. Furthermore, some of the dialogue in the game was high key cringe but that's a subjective take.

Combat: 9/10
Awesome combat. It took everything that was good in Monster Hunter World and cranked it up a notch by giving all the weapons more moves or more options. This was the best part of the game. The only gripes I have with the combat is that there is a lack of end game monsters that you actually want to fight because some of the monster fights are not fun at all. (I'm looking at you Doshaguma) and some weapon changes made some weapon play styles drastically different than the World counterpart.

QoL/UI features: 5/10
So many Quality of Life features were changed from Monster Hunter World and I just don't understand why. Monster Hunter World's argosy/farm was super easy to access and deal with as it was one quick ""collect all"" button, but in Wilds you have to go through the menu for each NPC which each follows to another menu for selecting items to gather again... it was really annoying because it was tedious and took really long for no reason. Lots of other features were changed too like which button to press to do certain actions like restocking or signalling and it confused me why Capcom decided to change things which had basically always been the same over their last games.

Visuals: 5/10
I'm not gonna sugar coat it, unless you are playing the game at ultra settings the game looks like dog water... and even at ultra settings it doesn't look particularly great. Most areas look super gray or washed out and it really ruins the visual aesthetic of the game. The only areas which I find look visually appealing are the Scarlet forest and the Windward Plains during the Plenty season.

Performance: 2/10
The game runs... that's where 1 point comes from. The other point is 1/10 for actual performance... I am running the game on a Ryzen 7 7700 + RTX 4080 PC and I struggle to reach above 60fps in 1440p Ultra settings on native resolution, let alone turning on the High Resolution Texture Pack... I'm sure I don't need to ramble on about how poor the performance is considering all the other reviews.

Overall: 7/10
Performance aside, the combat carries the game so hard; However, I found that there is a large lack of end game content as I had finished all the side quests by 40 hours and only have a few more crown hunting achievements to get before completing all the achievements. Overall the game could probably be almost fully completed in under 100 hours.",Recommended,2471,92.3 hrs on record,Posted: March 16
sophista,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sophista/,"Early review: I've had two friends with technical issues/crashing, but I haven't had any problems myself. One of them seemed to fix his issues by turning off XMP - ymmv. I feel badly for people who are having technical problems :( But, I also expect, based on how every Capcom release goes these days, that they'll be resolved within a month's time, so if you're worried, my advice is to hold off for a couple of patches, and then you should be gtg. **Take the SSD-required thing seriously. They aren't kidding about that.

My early bulletpoints, from someone with thousands of hours in MH, going back to the old handheld days when you didn't have two analog sticks and had to make paint pods and couldn't move and use consumables simultaneously, and had loading screens between every map zone:

-focus mode is weird and might long-term make some weapons non-negotiable for the kind of fun-hating people who care about The Meta, because it eliminates a core skill gate for harder-hitting weapons; on the other hand it means you spend less time whiffing with imperfect play so you can spend more time slapping monsters around which overall is probably good fun too
-talking palicoes are cursed AF, felyne language forever (could probably stand to leave those subtitles on the screen a hair longer tho)
-reviews that say this game looks worse than World are actual nonsense, game is gorgeous even in the brown, dusty wasteland. early monster and I scrap, roll around, come up covered in dust that silts away in the wind, chefkiss

- Needs more weapons
- Small glitches
- Price

eternallynumb,https://steamcommunity.com/id/eternallynumb/,"This game is bursting with so much detail on it's world and gameplay, that I have a hard time believing anyone would spite it just because it's ""cool"" to give away negative reviews nowadays. But then I remember we're in that age where everyone has an opinion on something, even when it's not an educated one or coming from a reasonable side.

Quite frankly, as streamlined as this game got (And not even in a bad way), it's one of the best Monster Hunter games I've ever played since the PS2 era. The additions and removals are welcome and feel natural, and the gameplay is as top notch as it's ever been. It feels easier without having been completely dumbed down, and still challenging where and when it should be, and is definitely a step up after Rise and World.

I also can't vouch for the ""optimization"" issues, because I have absolutely none. Frame rates drops a plenty but what.. 10-20 fps? Never enough to make it unplayable, I've had much worser experiences to be honest, and I can only imagine a lot of people complaining are still using outdated hardware.. and no, my PC isn't even that NASA material that everyone seems to be saying you need to run it.
Hilarious stuff... I honestly would've liked to see the ""gamers"" of nowadays playing on PS1 or even older gen stuff that sometimes would have games riddled with bugs and fps drops, and somehow everyone still played them, enjoyed them and pushed through, criticism was given to help developers move onwards and not curbstomped like they are nowadays.

I was scared to buy this game because everyone had been complaining about it, only to find out it's one of the most childish and biased attacks on a videogame ever. I can only imagine everyone pushing down negatives on it are just scaring away people from a great game, and then these are the same people that complain when franchises die or suddenly disappear forever.

Never crashed once, and fps has been buttery smooth. if it has dipped, it wasn't to a point where i was able to notice it. There are occasional pop ins and some funny glitches, but nothing game breaking. The only thing that's happened that was a bit frustrating was getting disconnected from friends during hunts a couple times, but it's nowhere near as bad or consistent as it was in rise. It only happened twice to me.
There was also a lot of talk about difficulty with this one too, and i don't exactly understand it that much. It seems a bit exaggerated to me. The early monsters were very easy and could have used a bit more health, but as the story progresses it ramps up and the final boss was a very fun challenge! Also keep in mind that the whole story is in low rank, so its not surprising that it was easy just as it's always been in previous monster hunter titles until you hit high rank or g rank. Also, i know the story has been a bit mixed, but i actually really enjoyed the story a lot this time around.

It's also Meh, Eight hours in, the story is kinda... One note? It's not particularly riveting to hear the same (Thing?) mentioned over and over again. There's a distinct 'Why should I care, I'm just here to hunt monsters so I can make fancy cool things'.

It's also astoundingly dark, there's a lack of vibrance in most areas. I found myself playing with the brightness settings often. I donno, maybe I'm getting old.

Everything that didn't work about the clutch claw from Iceborne and the mounting mechanics in sunbreak has been overhauled and smoothly integrated into the standard flow of combat, with plenty of weapon-specific mechanics integrated into the new systems. Their sum replacement - wounds - provides additional damage and utility that genuinely feels like a bonus and not a chore or absolute necessity for playing at all. Monster HP has been tuned to be closer to legacy versions of the game, so hunts feel concise and lend themselves well to doing ""just one more"", until suddenly it's midnight. Decoration RNG is still here, but changes to how and where you can socket them makes it far less pressing to get a half dozen copies of every meta decoration.

The game doesn't perform very well. You're encouraged to try and patch this up with upscaling and frame generation, but the game engine also forces on settings that don't play well with these - notably film grain and chromatic aberration. There are some technical issues - some unique to Windows, others unique to Linux and proton at time of review, and seeking technical help for any of them is a bit of a chore as the community at large is gaslighting each other into doing weird snake oil ♥♥♥♥ to ""fix fps"".

I am giving this a positive review because the game itself is very good, the character models and monster models have never looked better

You gather mats for crafting, you hunt monsters 100x just to get a freaking gem; its tedious and can be frustrating at times but for me that's what makes Monster hunter, monster hunter. In this game its feels like you re just handed everything, maybe that's why after a while it feels like there's nothing else to do.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197991011140/,"Monster Hunter Wilds – The best entry to the series since 2018

Disclaimer:
This review is the representation of my personal experience with the game. Issues and problems other may experience are not part of this review, since these did not apply or happen on my end.

We have here on of the best entries to the Monster Hunter Series since World in 2018. This game is such a beauty, not only to its stunning visuals it offers, but also the detailed world life itself.
Its very rare that we can experience such a detail loved worldbuilding and scenary. From the weather changes, to the monsters eco-behavior up to the detailed camp life.
Even the smallest things like palicos in the field, not just vanishing into air, but actualy walking back to camp and refill. Or corpses of Monsters not just vanishing but decaying and growing plants on them (ofc. this takes quite some CPU power). Nothing else in the last 5 years offers such a detailed and love-work world. In Things like These you just want to sink in and watch it progress. The gameplay loop is king again and a massive blast, alone or with friends!

This game is better then MH World (basegame) and is a massive improvement in any PoV towards it. Its not on the content level and feature level as Iceborne is, but we also just stay at the very start of this games life-cycle. With a future Master-Rank expansion like MH-Iceborne in the future, this game can reach legenday status in the games series.

One thing that i sadly have to mod in, is proper ultrawide screen support (5760x1080+ -> 48:9).
The feeling and emergion feeling it brings is a must, when you experienced it just once!



Its the perfect gameplay look to be expected from a Monster Hunter game, but done almost perfectly in the best simulation eco-system and a fully connected open world.



Starting a hunt goes more fluid then ever before, in the open field or with your handler that follows you everywhere you go, with no reason anymore to „teleport“ back to camp every time for a new hunt or quest. Thanks to the options to cook meals everywhere, the start of a hunt is dynamic as never before. You will encounter dynamic weather and biom changes that will effect endemic life and monsters alike.




Fast travel trough the wide lands, is also secured thanks to your new mount that fits the world building perfectly and does not feel forced in like the palamutes back in MH-Rise. I don’t want to go too much into detail here for story-spoiler reasons, but what is sadly missing so far is the palico kitchen or a proper managed arena with controlled encounters, but that may change in the future. Overall i can only say, gameplay is king again and the best reason to buy this game.

Capcom did what many had never expected them to do. Deliver a story that has focus on the overall World-Building of the Monster Hunter series, down to . I am trying to prevent very heavy spoilers for these who want to find out themself on what is revealed here. But let just the following screenshots speak for themself how close we are getting here to ...





Capcom did accept the feedback that many (new) players do not like long stories bound to hunter rank leveling. Therefore they did keep the main story bound to the low-rank experience of the game with a gameplay time of 10-15h, so that even casual players can see the credits with moderate gameplay time investment. For these who want to know more of the main story and its effect on the world, will have more additional story content in the high-rank part of the game. For the true monster hunter fans with interest in the series core-lore and world building story, this game is the houly gem of the entire games series. Going into details, would just be spoilers sadly.

We have here a Monster Hunter Game, that should already explain to everyone what to expect when it comes to grinding, hunting and completion. I do not have to explain that you need to hunt monsters for parts for your gear and weapon crafting. With some parts only available by cutting of parts of the monster or certain rare drops. All that is self-explained. What should be mentioned is that the RNG drops of decorations of MH-World is back. You can get more specificly by smelting later in the game, but the natural income of new decoration gems is the main grind next to Artian weapon parts. The main endgame-grind is all around making your gear perfect by getting the best decoration for your gear and RNG crafting the best Artian weapon for your needs. With friends on a daily 1-2h gameplay session, this is entertaining and rewarding alike.

There is one thing that does take the fun out of being a completionist. Hunting monster for gold-crowns is more easy then ever, thanks to the spy-glasses. Capturing endemic life is also quite easy because not all are achivment bound. What destroys all fun is the fishing with its mini-game mechanic. Capturing 30 whoppers or getting at least one Gajau is pure pain and 0 fun. If you can ignore that, do it and the gameplay fun will not break off for you.

You can achive quite the nice high-end gear with moderate grind investment:



As a direct successor game to MH-World, i can assure everyone this game managed to surpass it and being more then a worthy successor to it. It is not on the feature and content level of MH-Iceborne by far yet, but again its at the very start of its lifetime cycle and still awaits its Master-Rank expansion in the future. So far the basis for it looks and plays almost perfectly.

n4v1_,https://steamcommunity.com/id/n4v1_/,"7h for now, crashed 2 times, everything up to date, just checked. Relys HEVILY on DLSS and FSR. I've been having fun, hunting the monsters I like to make armors and all, I know lacks a little bit of content but more or less it's like World on release, not on performance, tho. The hammer feels awesome and the greatsword feels kinda the same, just a little bit faster. The seikret is cute af and love him, also usefull, I didn't really get used to the canyne on Rise. I like that it feels more like a mount than a faster 2nd player like the Canyne did and the autodrive really makes you appreciate the ambiance.

For those wondering, yes, there's more to the desert, you can get out pretty fast, tbh.

This one is more story driven and with the seikret it's always a follow mission, wich is pretty bad imo. Conami CAN absolutely tell great stories but (based on what i've played) this one is kinda in there, you play to get more monsters to hunt, not because it's enterteining in any way. Some say that Monster Hunter isn't the place to tell a good story, I think you can but it has to be in level with the gameplay, otherwise players get annoyed, all we want is hit big guy with big bonk stick.

I'm having fun, sucks that the game is still truly unoptimized and crashes but it's been fun for now.

The part where I'm crashing is just after you get to the second zone, right when you first see the signature monster. Skipping that cinematic helped but crashed anyway right after, could save just in time, tho.

Edit: Am I the only one who's monsters are spamming moves. I swear that the same dumb fish just roared like 3 times in a row without transforming or getting out of combat. Also he loves the divebomb for some reason",Recommended,1408,92.7 hrs on record,Posted: February 28

I love all the new specs, each armor given to me after every hunt has been absolute eye candy. It's been running smoothly for me for over 100 frames, which is odd to me, because my specs aren't as high compared to others here, even with a new updated graphics card I feel I got lucky with my game running the way it is. I can't say much of its optimization on that front since the game has been gorgeous, and honestly looks 10x better than what I was seeing from the beta. Each weapon has been easy to adjust and pick up on when trying new builds. And these have been the best monster designs I have seen in awhile. And the story has been interesting and more detailing compared to past monster hunter games. Plus handler is SUCH an upgrade in personality compared to the one in World.

Gwynbleidd23,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gwynbleidd23/,"Monster Hunter Wilds is the latest entry in the franchise, aiming to attract a more mainstream audience. The game introduces numerous QOL improvements, streamlining redundant activities and reducing the frustration caused by excessive RNG. These changes make the game more enjoyable and less frustrating.

The combat mechanics feel great, with more open zones and fluid animations that enhance the experience. Cutscenes are more frequent, and most notably, our protagonist is no longer silent. However, the story and soundtrack are fairly average and on the shorter side. The monster roster is also somewhat disappointing—while a few iconic monsters return, the selection feels lacking (Hopefully, future title updates will bring new monsters and further optimization.)

In terms of performance, I was quite lucky running the game on a Ryzen 7 7800X3D and RTX 4070 Ti. Over 30 hours of playtime, reaching HR 62, I only experienced one crash and playable on 80-100 fps depends on npc density.

You may be a newcomer, you may have started with the more modern games like world or rise, or you might be a long veteran of the series playing since classic monster hunter.

If you are a newcomer, this might be the best game in the series for you. Most of the ""meat"" of the game is seen through the games story, which means casual gamers or people wanting a stronger initial impression of the series will be in for a really good time.
If you are a world/rise player, this game will probably have some problems for you in terms of difficulty (high rank difficulty is even easier than world at launch currently), but will overall feel smoother and more engaging with the barrage of new weapon mechanics and unique monster designs.
If you are a long time veteran, you've seen this pattern with monster hunter games for long enough that you know the formula. You know the type of experience that you're getting with these games and this is absolutely one of the best feeling ones. You might tear through the content kind of quickly, which was definitely a problem I had, but so many weapons feel great to play in this entry that its pretty hard to get bored.

Monster Hunter Wilds is an exceptional step forward in the Monster Hunter franchise and the sales/player numbers prove it. This game serves as the strongest foundation the series has yet, and I have no doubt that future title updates and G/Master rank dlc will give us some really juicy content. There are definitely significant problems with difficulty, endgame grind, and performance, but each and every one of those will get better over time no doubt.

After roughly 160 hours or so of gameplay I feel like I have hit a point with the game that has made it a lot more enjoyable. I would 100% recommend this game as its fantastic and will only get better as time goes on. I just hope that Capcom can sort out the optimization a bit faster because at times it can really run your PC up a wall.",Recommended,1016,245.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 1

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198087975864/,"There’s some key points of discourse I’m reading online, after clearing low rank and only having 3 missions left in high rank, I feel like I have enough perspective now to actually write this.


PERFORMANCE:

TLDR; Not that bad, but needs some patches. Don’t let it steer you away.

Let’s get this outta the way first, no it isn’t perfect but people are absolutely TWEAKING when it’s like, really not that bad. I’m running a 3060ti, Ryzen 7800x and 32gb ddr4 ram. Not a bad system but by no means am I running something high end. Running 1440p ultrawide (the ugly cousin of 4K) if I could turn it down to 1080p without it looking muddy on my monitor I would, and the performance would be FLAWLESS on around medium-high settings. It’s still not bad, gets a bit choppy in a couple areas but it’s usually not in a hunt.


DIFFICULTY:

TLDR; Low rank easy, High Rank feels exactly the same as always.

I just came off of a first time playthrough of iceborne to freshen up the muscle memory, so yes, after getting stomped by Barioth for like 3 hours straight, this game feels a lot easier. However, I don’t think that’s the game, I think that’s just having hundreds of hours across the MH series. I do think the low rank hunts are quite a bit easier now, but low rank is basically the tutorial. High rank and especially tempered monsters get up into those 20-30 minute hunts you expect and HR elders are crip walking on my corpse. If you just spent a week slapping around Fatalis, I hope you don’t struggle with a Chatacabra.


MISC. PROS AND CONS:

PROS:
-Walking out into the open world and doing hunt after hunt is absolutely seamless and feels incredible, and the fact that this will start a quest automatically causes the grind to be cut down significantly due to quest rewards
-Alma is WAY more likeable than the handler from world
-Side characters are all very distinct and likeable/cool
-New monster designs overall are very cool as always
-VERY strong species variety
-Story was nothing to write home about but had some ridiculously dope moments (all worth it for the MC’s line before the final boss)
-Seikret speeds up area transitions while allowing you to heal, sharpen, buff etc
-Guardian variants are SO cool
-Final boss monster is maybe the coolest designs I have seen in one of these games so far

CONS
-Why is my Palico talking
-No visual differences between Alpha and Beta armor, even in colour
- Where is my boy pukei #freepukei
-Blangonga Ihateyouihateyouihat
-Although the monster type variety is strong, a few classes are sorely lacking (brute wyvern, fanged wyvern, flying wyvern)
-Seikret auto pilot can be a bit janky here and there
-This is a beg but would have liked to see a new weapon class


OVERALL:

Monster Hunter Wilds has gone by pretty quickly for me so far, but with future title updates I can see this game becoming one of my favourite games of all time. Want an extra challenge? Learn a new weapon. Wanna optimize that weapon? Go farm the gear for the best possible set for your play style. With so many weapon classes and so much content promised in the future (not even including the dlc, we’re talking free title updates) Wilds is gonna be in my rotation for a long time.

Capcom does need to work on optimizing this game and not relying on DLSS and Frame Gen, but I’m not reviewing the games industry I’m reviewing the game, and this game absolutely slaps me spits in my mouth and makes me say thank you

itsesh,https://steamcommunity.com/id/itsesh/,"First and foremost, I can only recommend it if your computer can actually run it. Mostly it just sucks that a launch this messy can happen even with all the experience Capcom has gained over the years by releasing their titles on PC.

That being said, Wilds is the ultimate culmination of quality of life upgrades in the series, occasionally to a fault as some aspects can leave you wanting where difficulty is concerned. There's still some baffling decisions that go against the grain, namely having to watch any given quest's cutscenes before being able to start them in multiplayer. But amongst things like your mount auto-tracking a monster's whereabouts, full cross-platform multiplayer, parts you break off a monster automatically being put in your inventory as opposed to becoming drops on the ground, simplified layered armor crafting, investigations being able to have guaranteed drops for a monster's rarest material, and plenty of others I'm probably forgetting: it's good. Very good.

And it's easy to say that the game feels light on content after having spent so much time with World/Iceborne and Rise/Sunbreak alongside the full sum of their title updates, but Wilds has plenty going on as it stands with obviously more to come. If you aren't inclined to fully engage with crafting multiple builds, or just diving into the real endgame that is fashion, then I could understand being underwhelmed after plowing through to the credits. But as someone who will be doing those things, and then jumping in to help my fellow hunters in random quests after the fact, the base game is nigh everything I was hoping for.

In reality to the main story is more aligned to take ~30-40 hours if you are quite literally not doing anything else and is steamrolling the game.

Another thing is the difficulty. Yes the beginning is easy, and so too was it in wilds, but it will progressively become harder. At HR 50, it starts to actually get sweaty and my MHW:Beta PTSD started to kick in. You'll have a good time, I am sure!

As for blurry graphics is the results of TAA or other temporal smeared solutions like DLSS if put on a low setting. I think if I should recommend performance/clarity, I'd lower the textures just to get a better temporal solution like DLAA or high quality DLSS. No temporal setting will likely be grainy due to how dithering transparency is used to save performance on a deferred rendering pipeline.

IamConstantine,https://steamcommunity.com/id/IamConstantine/,"8.5/10
A modernized monster hunter game, for better or for worse, the game felt somewhat more sanitized and simplified, but still done really well. It is certainly still a full blown monster hunter experience despite the changes they made, I did however dock some points due to performance issues

Review made based on Low Rank (main story arc) + couple early High Rank quests

GOOD
- The world felt much more alive, NPC patrols around the map, they converse and walk back to their spot after cutscenes
- The combat felt much more responsive and flexible, I personally love Focus Mode
- The weather system looks awesome, fighting during storms n such felt so epic
- is such an epic moment IMO
- Monsters does in fact look better than the previous game, graphically speaking
- Getting materials are less of a chore now since you get more drops overall from each hunts
- Being able to do hunts continuously without pause feels great, every monster within your rank gives you quest which means more money on average too
- Scripted scenes during the main story arc can be really cool at times


- Overall hunt is now faster, from the usual 20-30m to around 10-15m, whether it is good or bad is up to your preference, personally, it felt a bit too fast, but maybe its because its still early game
- The world design doesn't really feel expansive, but more akin to MH Worlds map connected to each other, I was expecting the open world to be actually ""open"", but they just mostly replaced the loading screen with a discreet path between each region, prob more of an expectation problem on my end
- The story is definitely more palatable, as in easier to understand, with more emotional (or at least trying to be) scenes , but it is now shorter than the old game (at least main arc), the theme is pretty cliche and overall very meh. Again, preference thing
- The game doesn't just feel faster, it also felt easier and more casual, depending on your expectations for the game, you might not like this, some people prefer to be challenged after all, I personally like the QoL improvement but also really wished that the fights were a bit harder, maybe that'll change once the real end game starts
- Lipsync is a bit jarring at times, lots of awkward pauses, though it might be due to the game not being designed for EN voiceovers(?)
- Multiplayer system is improved compared to previous game, but i feel like it could still be better and simpler than this...


- Performance is atrocious, the graphical improvements does not warrant the massive performance hit that it currently has, this game needs more time in the oven ngl... I'm running top tier PC (7800X3D/4090 @ 4K Max) and I still had to rely on DLSS + Frame gen to maintain smooth experience, which i think is BS
- Pop-in is a recurring problem, very much noticable especially when doing quick camera flicks, texture has noticable delay before being fully rendered, applies to even the terrain geometry in some cases
- The story fights felt too easy that it might be a bit of a trap for new players, I barely had any need to upgrade my equipment throughout the whole main story arc (15-20h) so I'm concerned that some people might get lulled into a false sense of security when they finally reached High Rank
- I kinda miss the sense of danger that we get from MH World, things like Anjanath lurking around during your early Low Rank hunts or Bezelguise during your early High Rank hunt, that feeling of unknown threat is missing, at least throughout the whole main story arc, because fights are much more hand-crafted and safe....
- Game keeps buggering me about internet connection on the menu, THIS IS A SINGLEPLAYER GAMES, STOP TRYING TO MAKE SINGLEPLAYER GAMES ALWAYS ONLINE (you can probably play with steam offline mode, but the fact that the game keeps trying to connect to internet when you have no connection is FKING ANNOYING)",Recommended,3216,91.0 hrs on record,Posted: March 5

imptwins,https://steamcommunity.com/id/imptwins/,"This is being written before any of the game's major updates, about three weeks after launch. And it's being written by an insane old lady who started playing this franchise on her Playstation 2 in 2005, who cares about it more than she ought to. I also had a lot of fun in my 50 hours so far. Hitting 'no' on whether I recommend it isn't really a literal 'I do not recommend the game'. It also has nothing to do with the extremely valid criticisms of the game's extremely dogwater performance. Keep all that in mind.

I don't think my take on Wilds is going to be a popular one, even with as many critics as it's building up. Which is fine, I'm used to that, World is the first time I've actually agreed with majority consensus on this franchise, while before that I would have still insisted Unite was the best in the series. That isn't a popular take. But I really can't help but feel like Wilds has gone in a bad direction for the long-term health of the series. Not because of the shorter hunts or the 'lack of content' that you may have already heard complaints about, especially that latter one. I DO think there's some truth to it, I think even at launch World had a lot more to do, but zero question that perception is mostly from people remembering World in its final state.

My issue is that this game feels completely frictionless. The game doesn't feel like it ever stops me, it doesn't feel like it ever trips me up. Everything is so easy to do, not just the fights but supplies and food and inventories and unlocks and layered gear and, just everything. Your mount automatically sends you to where you need to go and everything you'd ever need is put in your pocket then the big monster dies after tapping you on the wrist a couple times and that's that. Even that example I gave before, there's just as many palico gadgets and we obviously still have a mount, but you just kinda. Get them. I didn't have to explore some weirdo unmarked nook of the map to do a weirdo unmarked quest for some random unmarked cats, I just kinda got it. Everything is laid out for you, handed to you.

There's good and bad to the friction being gone. I love that sharpening is actually possible to do mid-fight solo now, but I feel like it's too generous that my seikret can just pick me up to bail me out of anything at all ever. I'm not going to miss Nergigante's 'roar which stuns you for long enough that you don't have time to sheathe your weapon to superman dive away from his now undodgeable attack' garbage, but I'm not sure I like that trade if it means NOTHING feels threatening. Nobody liked the old deco drop rates but... I dunno, it feels a little hollow finishing my build 50 hours into the game. Half of this stuff wouldn't be bad on its own, and half of it is actively good, but all at once? Remove ALL the friction, good and bad, at once? It makes it feel aimless, insubstantial, braindead. The game is so devoid of ANY sort of friction that I'm sitting over here feeling nostalgic about paintballs and mid-fight combining, for gods sake. Those were NOT good mechanics, but in a room full of padded walls I'm craving something concrete, something with some weight to it.

I think my biggest gripe - and I KNOW this take is going to be super unpopular - is focus mode. I just don't think I should be able to throw out attacks nonstop without thinking about them and relying on focus mode's 180s to trivialize positioning. To me, the essence of monhun is the need for commitment, for planning, the fact that having to consider so many things regarding monsters and your own movement and positioning in advance not only necessitated deeply learning monsters' behaviours, but rewarded you massively for it. Landing a TCS on a mobile monster used to be a thing of mastery and beauty and now it's just... Nothing.

The game honestly kinda feels more adjacent to Helldivers than World. A party game that exists purely for small groups of friends to roll loot slot machines in. And don't get me wrong, I like those kind of games, but that's not what monhun was to me.

Regardless of whether future monsters do more damage and take longer to kill, that won't change the fact that focus mode makes positioning nearly redundant, that every single weapon has get-out-of-jail-free moves, that the big moves just aren't hard to pull off anymore given they're either twice as fast or have super armour or both and even if you do screw it up completely you can roll out of it before it's even gone off, that your seikret ensures it's nearly impossible to get combo'd out, that the absolute worst the game can do is put up a Quest Failed screen and take away the 5 mega potions you used on the fight from your stash of 800.

I said at the start of this that I don't necessarily not recommend the game. But, at present, I would definitely recommend you to play World first. Too many edges got sanded down, I think. It's lacking the franchise's usual weirdness, and its abrasiveness. You can give the upcoming update monsters 10 times more HP, but it won't bring back the feeling of satisfaction that overcoming those rough edges brought.

In retrospect Monster Hunter Wilds is a very ironic name for something that feels so completely toothless.

EDIT: I did not expect so much attention on this, let alone for it to all be positive. Thanks for that! Especially the people sharing their old hunting stories, so, lemme share one of my own nostalgic hunting stories as thanks.

I still hadn't 'got' monhun when Unite came out, despite playing 1, 2 and F2. Nargacuga was the flagship monster for that game and I really liked (and still like) its design. I got the quest to hunt it, suited up with my trusty old Akantor armour, and decided on dual blades for it. One of my weaker weapons but it felt appropriate. And, like, what's the worst that could happen? I wasn't even in G Rank yet.

I drastically underestimated how tough a fight it would be, and wasn't nearly good enough with DB for it. I carted twice quickly just from being blindsided. I played safer from then but was still getting knocked around.

I went through my entire potion supply. I kept fighting but got low on HP and ran off to actually use the tent to heal (a lot of people didn't even know you could do that in the older games lmao), and do some old fashioned on-field procurement of potion materials, despite being unfamiliar with the new map. I hadn't had to do that since monhun 1. I thought about going home for the hammer but despite the struggle I was just... having fun. It really did feel like I'd just met something that was my match and I had to knuckle down and learn it.

I somehow managed to keep surviving, but the timer was becoming an issue. I'd barely even remembered quests had a time limit. I basically had no hopes for finishing it off, I was just keeping up the fight as practice. But I kept swinging when I could. Past 45 minutes I stopped going off to gather even when I fell into fatal range. And with literally less than a minute on the clock, it died. Out of almost all my supplies, battered and broken, hanging onto my last life by a thread, but I managed it.

It's still my favourite monster hunter memory. As Wilds is, it's really hard to imagine it making a story, and a feeling, like this. World gave me some similar ones with some of the nastier monsters. Most of those memories were from Iceborne, though, so I do still think there's hope for Wilds to turn out some great moments with AT patches or the inevitable expansion, but like I say in the review, patches can up the numbers but they can't make Helmsplitter satisfying again.

But also like I said in the review, I didn't really like the games between Unite and World much. It's not the end of the world if Wilds still winds up mid after everything. I waited 9 years between monhuns I actually liked before and I can do it again.

Happy hunting, y'all.",Not Recommended,6471,56.4 hrs on record,Posted: 16 March

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058055476/,"Here's the most relevant reasons the game feels so bad until high-rank:

1. Performance, and fidelity. Reasonable framerates on everything but the latest GPUs come at the cost of textures that look straight out of a ps2 game half the time. Why do my scoutflies look like minecraft particle effects when I'm not 2 inches from them? Why does having more than 2 entities on screen, or rotating my camera at all, cause stuttering? The difference in quality between this and other recent AAA titles is staggering. Wilds has such good designs and animations, which get severely neutered by the absolutely broken performance.

2. Multiplayer cohesion. It is miserable to have to re-join a quest, only after someone has actively started the hunting portion of the quest, when you have played along the exact same questline. Not only that, even if you're playing in tandem, you have to ACTIVELY run away from the hunt you're trying to complete together in order to even re-join your friends, since the game gives you a connection error if you get hit by the monster you were immediately forced to fight. It's crazy that they managed to un-fix a problem I thought they'd resolved in other titles.

Good lord, it's miserable. Are you going to get a cutscene that forces you to leave the area immediately after a quest? Or maybe a dialogue sequence you have to skip through one message at a time? Or an unskippable auto-walk at the slowest possible movement rate on your seikret? After 2-4 of these, randomly chosen, you will be immediately thrust into a hunt that lasts all of 5 minutes. Repeat until the credits roll.

Worlds and Rise both had significantly harder monsters than anything in Wilds. They have tiny health pools that make it so you barely engage a monster before it's dead. Their attacks do negligable damage that is healed with 1 potion (or better yet by your palico which you no longer have any choices to make regarding their tools), and there's no threatening follow-ups to the monster attacks on the off-chance they even get you low enough to care. Wounds spawn constantly, and borderline stunlock monsters when you proc them. I never, ever felt anything that could qualify as a challenge, not even on the final boss, and so I felt like I had to rush the game to even have a chance at enjoying any gameplay, because HOPEFULLY high-rank is a little less trivial.

There is literally no reason to do any exploring, at all, ever. The closest you could get to an incentive would be for pop-up camp locations. Your seikret transports you to all but two destinations automatically, and the entire map and all of it's resources are revealed. There's no gameplay-driven reason to hunt for anything, and it is so sad because the artists put tremendous work into the scope and detail of the world, and the monsters, and the environments, and it all gets wasted because you're never made to gather monster tracks, or do an expedition, or hunt for gathering spots.

When you combine all of these factors, you get a game that feels like it's trying to say It's insane how many systems they discarded that validated the entire experience of Monster Hunter. God, I hope high-rank has some challenge to it at least. It's unforgiveable how badly they designed this game in totality.

When the multiplayer works, it has the same problems as World, like needing to start quests solo, find the objective, watch a cutscene, exit the quest, and join a friend to actually play the game together.

Why? You already had a good system in Rise. If you're going to do sequences and cutscenes, let me at least bring a friend along.

Also, link groups are a stupid mechanic. Why is progression not tied to the lobby?

For the brief minutes where I do manage to fight the monster with friends, it's a really fun experience. This game may very well have the best combat in the series. I genuinely don't know why you designed the multiplayer this way.

Edit: A lot of you mentioned playing from a squad lobby, and it did make joining after the cutscene much more bearable, but I still don't like the game's singleplayer oriented design for the story quests, especially when Rise and GU story quests both work flawlessly with multiplayer.

I want to preface that I've finished the main story & beaten every monster the game has to offer.

This game, wholeheartedly, is a downgrade in almost every aspect when compared to the previous titles. It's ""OK"" - but there's a lot of things that are just... bad decisions. They'll sell ""fixes"" through an expansion, like they did with Rise, but it's still NOT GOOD in the current state.

We lost SO many quality of life changes.
---------------------------------


Graphical downgrade and terrible optimization. The game looks brown. Everything looks brown. There's filters/settings enabled that just makes it look *bad* - Sometimes, like in the lush forest, it looks incredible when the fog is off... but everywhere else it looks washed out. The FPS is awful (There's a typo in the config file you can fix to add a little more) and you will struggle to get over 60 FPS on average/decent computers.

No idea what happened in testing.

---------------------------------

Multiplayer is terribly implemented. There's lobbies, link parties, environment links, and a billion other things you need to juggle just to play with people. We seriously went from >make lobby >join lobby >post quests and play... to whatever this is. Even if you're IN THE ENVIRONMENT LINK WITH FRIENDS you still get disconnected sometimes after defeating a single monster. It makes no sense.

You're forced into 'cutscene gates' where you can't do things with people until you see certain things.. something that was FIXED in World because it was SO HATED AND ANNOYING. It's back! Playing with friends is ROUGH until you're at the end of the game.

---------------------------------

The game is incredibly theme-parky and ACTIVELY DISCOURAGES exploration. You are tethered to certain areas while doing any story mode missions. World encouraged vertical exploration and players to go around on their own, but on here everything is listed, shown, and auto-pathed to by your mount.

There is no central hub, so it feels like you're constantly jumping around ""exhibits"" to find NPC's, quests, turn things in, and do whatever. It's very broken up, sparse, and feels incredibly clunky and jarring to navigate compared to the previous two titles (and even older ones). I guess they're adding a central hub eventually but didn't have enough time? Sucks.

It feels like they took Frontiers and mutilated it, trying to have an ""MMO FEEL"" without any MMO mechanics. I cannot tell you the number of times I've had to look everywhere to find where to turn in quests.

Even things like MAP MARKERS for camps are buried by other markers IN CAMPS and they're really difficult to see/fast travel to. The way the list of camps were shown in World made it *brain dead easy* to find... How did we go to this?

---------------------------------

The story is very bland. I'd even say that it's awful. I won't go into spoilers or specifics, but there's absolutely no ""big catastrophe"" you're trying to avert or anything major that's being built up to.

Most of the dialogue is patronizing, condescending, or very ""life is special"" - and it just rings really hokey. There's also not even a dragonator anywhere in the entire game. I'd put it on the same level as ""base"" Rise's story, which says a lot.

There's very few memorable characters, moments, or anything along those lines. Part of what makes some of the story of the previous titles so good is how extra and over the top some of the characters are. Again, no dragonator moments.

It can also be completed in less than 10 hours without rushing. It just kinda.. ends.

---------------------------------

The experience feels soulless. I dunno how else to put it other than feeling like nothing is inspired, and more like everything was ""lets do this again"" in Wilds. It feels like there was no vision beyond ""Make another World game"" and Capcom executives yelling at the developers to do so. The phrase I've heard a LOT of friends using (who are veterans of MH far longer than I am, since the original) is that it feels *incredibly* corporate.

You kinda just get it as a vibe. As you play through, the longer you play through, you'll understand what I mean.

---------------------------------

Monster variety is very limited, and there's nothing really ""stand out"". Even the flagship monster is uninspired compared to previous title flagship monsters. Going through the entire game, killing every single monster available, I cannot think of a single one that impressed me or made me go ""woah"" on the same level of things like Vaal Hazak, Velkhana, Malzeno, Xeno'Jiiva, etc had to offer. It feels like you're fighting three archetypes the entire game.

A lot of monsters are repeats from previous games, including the movesets and skeletons (which have been used on a few of the new ones), which is a bit disappointing considering how few actually exist.

I'm actually worried about future content because most of the announced monsters are just filler/mid tier monsters... and the game's already done. The escalation wont be there unless they add things like Alatreon, etc, alongside smaller threats.

---------------------------------

There's no endgame. You farm two or three tempered monsters at the end and that's it. There's no carrot on a stick to pursue and you'll be done as a dedicated player within a few days. I won't go into extreme detail but yeah, nada.

---------------------------------

Decorations are really weird now. Most attack based ones can only be put on weapons (Such as ballistics, etc), which means only 3 slot weapons can fit them. Three slot slots on armor/etc CANNOT wear the same decorations as weapons. This severely limits builds. Most armor sets also are just *incredibly* lackluster when it comes to skills provided.

I get this limits player power but.. it just feels really clunky on how they did it.

---------------------------------

The entire new wound system is just clutch claw from Iceborne but way more auto-pilot. You do huge amounts of damage while wounding, get free materials, and CONSTANTLY KNOCK DOWN MONSTERS from applying wounds. There's fights you're going to do later once you're geared where monsters cannot get up off of the ground.

People complained about the clutch-claw gameplay and this is just the exact thing.. but WAY more overtuned and broken. Even the hardest monsters the game has to offer kinda get destroyed by any sort of wound mechanic.

---------------------------------

The food system is a downgrade. I get what they were going for but in simplifying it they've made it kinda awful. Getting materials sucks, the stores that sell/offer ingredients only seem to give you rations, and the bonuses from food are lackluster. We went from having major defense up, attack up, ammo conservation, and all these other awesome things to just basic buffs.

NOT TO MENTION THERE'S NO PALICO CUTSCENES FOR FOOD COOKING. RIP Grandma food cat.

---------------------------------

The camera is awful. Monsters are bigger than your screen and tracking is bad. Can't count the number of times later that bigger monsters are just 95% of your screen and you can't see what they're doing fast enough. Even at max zoom/focus it's a downgrade from World.

---------------------------------

I *want* this game to be better than it is and I know they'll make it better in the future, but man, I wouldn't be surprised if I see lots of people going back to play World/Iceborne after a couple of weeks of Wilds.

The game picks a healing item for me automatically, so what is the point of the plethora of different healing items? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) Sharpening my weapon just amounts to pressing a button whenever I remember it, so what is the point of the sharpening mechanic? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) You can beat any fight with any equipment, so what is the point of all these complicated weapon stats? (Because it's a vestige of when you actually had to think about it.) It feels like, if Capcom were designing this game from scratch, 75% of these systems wouldn't even be in it. Because they all add friction and Capcom doesn't want there to be any friction any more. In that sense, it's kind of a mess.

Beyond that, the point about the equipment sums up how Wilds has broken the loop that made previous MH games so satisfying (already an issue in Rise but absolutely terminal here). Your impetus for hunting the same monsters again and again is supposed to be that you NEED those materials to win your next fight – and you need to master your weapon for the same reason. But in Wilds none of that matters. I will admit that combat feels great. But WINNING doesn't feel great, because it's no longer the culmination of anything except mashing buttons. The reason I want a real challenge isn't to prove how skilled I am, it's because a challenge makes you engage with the game more deeply, and so gives you a richer, more sustained experience, which you think about even when you're not playing. Without that, you're left with a nicer-looking but much shallower retread of Monster Hunter World, and that hasn't been worth £60 to me.

The game runs well on my machine but that's no excuse for how badly it runs on most machines, especially when this is a game that you play with friends.

I generally dislike leaving negative reviews when a game just released because I'm afraid it'll seem like jumping on the ""hate the popular thing"" bandwagon etc.
However.
The perfomances are one thing I can ignore, it doesn't run good but it runs well enough on my machine, I can wait for updates for that

What I cannot ignore however is the inability of the game working on top of the line AMD GPUs, I have a 7900XT and the game crashed on startup, until I figured I had to turn on WINDOWS 7/8 COMPATIBILITY MODE IN THE EXECUTABLE PRORIETIES

And that's where the huge problem lies, if you turn on Comp mode, half of the textures ♥♥♥♥ themselves, I'm not talking about a lttle artifact here and there, I'm talking about a MASSIVE artifact covering the ENTIRE screen as soon as there's a rock in frame, this is unnacceptable especially for the flagship product of a company
And you cannot turn it off once you booted, you'd think maybe the issue was shaders compiling, or something
But no.
Turning off comp mode brings the game back to crash on startup

I still put up with it considering it's either that or no monstie at all, but the review is a solid negative and will stay as is until the problem get hotfixed.

Since I'll be the one with 5,000 hours in Wilds, just like I did in World, I need to be strict and not deny what's wrong with the game (even if I'm not suffering from it). I only play while I'm live on Twitch, and having an active community of people that LOVE the franchise, hearing so many bad things about performance, makes me not want to recommend the game, only for that reason. But there's more that I'll discuss later. It's unacceptable to buy a game that has been promised to us for so long and not be able to play it, even when we have the PC config to do so.

Apart from not being able to run the game, we now need to be CAREFUL with performance MODS because for some obscure reason, Capcom decided to HUNT and PERMANENTLY BAN whoever they please, even if the person is not cheating, without giving a reason AND without letting the person prove that they didn't cheat in the game, and only used tools to RUN it properly. QoL mods, tools such as FOV editor and ReShade WILL BE FLAGGED as CHEATS if Capcom wants, and their word is the last. That's abuse of power and should be UNACCEPTABLE by us, consumers. WE bought the 10 million copies in the first month. WE made Wilds break records. Not the investors, so STOP PLEASING THEM.

We need CLARITY in communication with players, us, the FANS who will be playing for hours on end. We will consume and be affected by shady communication, obscure reasoning and abuse of power without even being able to prove that Capcom is wrong.

Capcom, listen. Remove ARENAS from Wilds, focus on making meaningful content. Stop targeting mods. Cheaters CANNOT do ANY harm to ANY player. If there's more rewards than normal on a quest, people shouldn't enter it. If someone hit kills a monster, the person should quit the game without saving. Besides that, this game is 100% PVE and NO CHEATER can do ANYTHING to get to anyone. Rethink your actions, innocent players do not need to be afraid of enjoying the game that they bought with their own money. No one cares about leaderboards.

furfagjenkins,https://steamcommunity.com/id/furfagjenkins/,"Monster Hunter is my childhood series of nearly 16 years,

Optimisations are not the sole issue.

Performance has been unnecessarily poor for many people. However, fixing this will not solve the game's frustrating nature.

Visual design is great. Combat has been truly impeccable. However, every other sect of direction has lain the devil in the details, creating a grossly obstructive and discouraging experience while taking multiple steps back from the whole series. It's clear the game is unfinished.

As a whole package, when only one of the main components established over 20+ years is done well and worthwhile side content is summed up by 'the fishing's kinda cool now', there is a huge problem.

So TL;DR: Roundabout and cluttered UI, and a story whose beats are brief and forgettable on purpose, yet is frustratingly paced, stretched and ground down rails like something worth telling - handholding far exceeding time actually spent hunting. Insult to injury comes from ignoring Rise for an obtuse multiplayer worse than World's painful 'leave and restart the quest to let friends join' system.

All to imprison you in a title whose major innovation is finally being open world for 'player freedom'.


On UI:

Try adding a friend you already know through this game without joining the same lobby. There's no dedicated ""Friends"" menu. You will probably take 10 minutes. Wanna play together? Go to the same lobby. Now you need a link party. Now you need to...

It is a sub menu jungle: poorly planned, explained and labelled.

More importantly, there's a HUD ripped from a 'corporate open world slop' mockup you'd find around Elden Ring's release. Most of it can be customised, but there's a beady, omnipresent and unremovable objective marker, duplicated on the un-customisable minimap telling you where everything is through visual barf; it all blends together.



1) Straight forward step. Pick out your items and equipment. Eat. Head out. It's a light strategic phase relying on memory and your personal preference. Without it you make life 10x harder.

2) Huge part of what makes MH special. Exploration and becoming familiar with a location, its details and secrets were given similar importance to learning the behaviors and patterns of the monster you hunted because of how they - and you - are intertwined. Your understanding is personal and ropes you into feeling part of the world. Since environmental hazards came out, this saw explicit gameplay reward too.

3) Before World it was your way to secure your combat reward for good scouting, with light management because paintballs wore off. World made it an additional reason to engage with the environment; how well it was done is up to interpretation.

4) Self explanatory. The meat of the game and main reward for locating the target monster.

You may notice these are simplified steps to actual hunting.


Immediately knowing where everything is defeats the need and incentive to explore. How the hell are we expected to care for cool spots we never discovered ourselves? Stray too far and the game yanks you away for daring to look at something new. Somehow they removed joy and wonder from higher tier environment design. At least they let us physically ignore 90% of the world by holding a button to laser focus on text in the most braindead iteration of gathering to ever grace us.

This is what's removed outright, replaced by the tacky magic objective marker. Tracks still exist but only give you currency. Scout flies became useless by World's endgame so that's why?

Believe it or not sneak attacks and bushes exist as afterthoughts to some basic stealth system. If they wanted to remove tracking, What if our ""intelligent"" seikret could be taught to help with this? Why didn't they replace scoutflies with the raptor following scents?

Wanted to keep the flies and tracking anyway? Have them trained to only follow monsters tagged by paint for the whole hunt. Ruin hiding tactics or some amazing camouflage that's hard to see with the naked eye. It's reason to care about rain too.

Right now, only having prep for battle sounds like a glorified boxing ring.


Each of these are so far absent:

-Home customisation
-Endemic life as pets
-Mounts engaging in combat
-Collectables
-Raids

Cooking skill variety is pretty sad compared to every other game too.

MH games always offered 'extra'. (Raids would need improving)




The mind-numbing kind.

1) The devs failed to develop a new, fun, gameplay buildup to engage with before fighting, nor have they balanced the combat to really let you partake in this part's stellar system. 5-10 minutes when hours deep is immensely dissatisfying. It's a potato chip experience: tastes great but is gone too soon. Rise and World got it just right.

2) Decorations are segregated on whether they're a 'weapon gem' or 'armor gem', removing creative slot management and the satisfaction of optimal builds how wanted. Very old games would add to one skill and take from another. Balancing that prevented OP builds better than this restrictive, over-corrective mess.

3) World let you breathe - Wilds crushes your windpipe. Progression for ~75% of your first 8-16Hrs is stuck in the most shallow, uninspired nothingburger drivel, forcibly handholding you throughout it all. Some interesting lore and that's it. Frequent are shacklings to tiny spaces just in case you wanted to - God forbid - play the game. Combine how the hunts are and the bore drills deep.



Unlike any other MonHun, you can't really look, learn or enjoy outside combat. Minimal side content. Constant nags on where to go, where to stand, who to speak to and when play's allowed between each. And every. Quest... Sounds like a school - that fun to you?

And it's tragic because there are cool, fun little details with beauty to witness. Again, combat is fantastic. But for all these efforts to make the game worth playing, someone in Capcom's out of touch management either refused to let the game cook or stirred the pot, thinking MH as 'just another action game' when the legs are built on so much more. Now sloppy and missing features encroach on what gives it character.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198040962204/,"As someone who has been playing the Monster Hunter series for 20 years, this is easily the most disappointed I've been in a MH release.

Performance issues aside, they have dumbed down the series to cater to a greater audience. I guess people got tired of hunting monsters in a Monster Hunter game, so Capcom decided to turn them all into loot pinatas which are mostly stagger-locked due to the new wounding mechanic.

While the new movesets and mechanics like offsets and power clashes feel great, it feels like there's barely any time to get into the heat of combat when hunts are over in 5-7 minutes. With focus mode, you no longer need to worry about positioning or waiting for openings as you can brute-force every monster in the game. Hunters have more tools and much expanded moveset/mobility to deal with threats but monsters seem to have lost the majority of theirs - wind pressure, tremor, blights barely exist in the game and/or have little to no impact. Roars no longer open you up to follow-ups and it is near impossible to get stunned.

I understand a chunk of the difficulty from older titles came from overall jank and funky hitboxes (plesioth, I'm looking at you!) and the games have gradually become easier as we see more QoL come to the series, but Wilds is in a whole different league of ease even when compared to base World and Rise.

Playing with skills and creating builds, which is a huge part of the game for me, has never been more dull. Decorations are now split into weapon and armor categories with 99% of the offensive skills being locked to weapons. Most armors have purely defensive/utility skills now so no more crit/attack/element or even guard skills are on armor. Weapons from the weapon tree now come with a built-in skill or two, but several are essentially useless (like draw skills on lances and focus on glaives) and as a result, your build variety is incredibly limited. I feel like it was set up this way to deal with the new system allowing you to equip 2 weapons at the same time - which in itself is pretty pointless when hunts are over in under 10 minutes and you can literally fast travel to a camp WHILE IN COMBAT. The only time I've swapped weapons is to greatsword a sleeping monster or swap elements for 2-monster hunts. That aside, the armor and weapon designs are fantastic.

At first glance, the world seems grand and robust with plenty to explore, but the entire map is uncovered as you enter the zone. Exploration only goes skin-deep as you are forced use your seikret to traverse certain areas and what you're left with is a lot of big empty spaces. There's no sense of world when your dino chicken mount just auto pilots you everywhere as you drive-by gather. The environmental/weather changes are cool at least and there's some neat ecosystem stuff to explore but the zones themselves felt very washed out, drab and weren't memorable at all, but scarlet forest is cool at least.

There is currently no real form of endgame or reason to play after killing the last tempered monster as you will likely get all the mats you need in 1-2 hunts. You don't even need to grind rubies anymore as investigations offer guaranteed ones.

I was finished with the game around the 40 hour mark, including the 'endgame monsters' and making their sets. I did not skip story or cutscenes either. Any gametime after this was mostly hanging out in chat with friends, helping them or idling. I want a reason to play more but there is no sense of progression or something to build towards.

The game is very hand-holdy with Alma (your handler) constantly remarking the same line for tempered monsters, reminding you to carve tails and that you can carve small monsters and most of the story consists of on-rails walk and talks. There is also a very, very annoying notification system that constantly bombards you with less than useful info. I don't need to know that there's an upsurge of thunderbugs or that the Chatacabra 1km away somehow got blinded. The button to dismiss these notifications is the same one to open your map, and you can't open the map until they're dismissed. Also the UI is a horrid mess full of nested menus - and while you CAN customize them, I just couldn't be bothered.

All in all, MH Wilds has a lot of questionable design choices that are at odds with itself and the game feels rushed. Aside from bowguns, the new weapon movesets look and feel great. Focus mode/wounds need some serious re-balancing and despite them focusing heavily on an ecosystem, the world feels mostly dull washed out.

ILoveRaidenMei,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ILoveRaidenMei/,"Product received for free

Before getting into this review I just wanna point out that I, by no means, hate the game. I actually like the game a lot, however it has some very substantial flaws that I wanna talk about.
I usually don't write reviews so there will probably be a lot of ranting or I will go off topic etc, however I just felt like I had to voice my thoughts on wilds as a long term monhun player (started with P2ndG and played almost every main title past it, except for tri and the Japan exclusives.)



THE GOOD
I'll start by talking about the good points of monster hunter wilds.

The game is fun which is usually a good thing. However in wilds' case it isn't, since the game severely lacks in variety and content which I will talk about later. The game introduced a new combat mechanic, the focus mode, which is surprisingly fun to use and definitely an improvement from the clutch claw from world and the wirebugs from rise despite it being overpowered. The open world is definitely something monster hunter needed as it emphasises the whole hunter aesthetic and is a cool concept and way better than having to load into a new zone every time a monster decides to run away. The combat and fluidity of weapons is surprisingly good, even though they made some rather questionable changes to some weapons.

That, however, is all I can really give this game in terms of good points..

Let's start by addressing the elephant in the room . Holy hell did Capcom mess up the performance in this game.

My computer is pretty decent I'd say and is not very old (around 2 years). Despite that however, I can only really manage to get around 50 to 60 FPS at most, with low settings, DLSS on performance etc. I usually get around 120 FPS in most games that I play. It's just horrendously bad compared to rise and even world, a game that had performance issues as well (Fun fact: before I got my current computer, I played on an actual potato: 8 gbs of ram, a very old 1050 ti, some random i5 processor and some broken hdds. But even on that computer I could reach around 50 FPS in world on medium settings.)

Obviously, I could always just upgrade my computer, but that wouldn't really fix the root of the issue and is not really necessary. The reason why the performance in this game is such a mess is because Capcom decided to make this game in the RE engine for some reason, an engine designed for Resident Evil games. And even in those games there were performance issues to my knowledge.
They did make some performance improvements compared to the beta however, they're barely noticeable.

Second of all, the graphics in this game are also quite a let-down. The game looks worse than world, a game that came out around 7 years ago and Capcom somehow managed to make half the game look blurry or like a PS1 game. I'm usually not really a graphics guy, but I thought it'd be good to point out.

Next up, the .
Content has always been a very big part of monster hunter. You could pump thousands of hours into these games without ever getting bored, be it the base game or the g rank version. They toned down a bit on that with worlds and rise which is ""fine"" albeit disappointing. Yet this game somehow manages to have no content at all.
You're probably asking yourself right now: but we have tempered and frenzied monsters. How is there no content??? Well, it's quite simple, most monsters aren't really relevant for the end game. In fact, Arkveld and Gore Magala are the only monsters that are really worth killing. Apart from that, you're really just playing the game for the sake of forcing content.

Frenzied monsters used to be such a massive thing in MH4 and MH4U, but they're a complete joke in this game. It's like they turned a hydrogen bomb into a coughing baby. They are so over-nerfed, they can hardly be called frenzied monsters anymore. We don't even have apex monsters (yet).
And tempered monsters are just tempered monsters but also somehow weaker. I've always had my gripes with tempered monsters, since they're essentially just ""artificial"" difficulty and therefore not really a new fight. They're just the same monster, but with more health and damage. But even they got nerfed and are barely recognisable from world. This, combined with the fact that the overall difficulty in this game is below average and elder dragons being completely non-existent, makes for a very lacklustre game difficulty.

So when you are done with the game and finally reach the end game you are basically just hunting Arkveld again, again, again, again, again and . Maybe splash some Gore here and there and that's it. There is no reason to hunt any other monster besides them, which sucks, because they added some really cool new monsters e.g: Rey Dau or Jin Dahaad (even though I'm not a big fan of these big one-shot mechanics).
Hunting Arkveld is fun, but it just gets tiring and boring after the 100th Arkveld and, unless you are a content creator or speedrunner, there is little to no reason to hunt so many Arkvelds. Sure, you could just try to complete all the achievements, which will keep you busy for a while, but there are only so many achievements you can get and achievements should never be the main appeal of a game. It should be the .

And lastly but not least, another thing I wanted to address is the story. Jesus bare with me. The story is pretty much just 60% cut scenes until one of the npcs runs into trouble, and you have to save them from a monster. It's boring, insufferable and just unnecessarily forced upon you. If you play monster hunter for the story, then that's good for you. Most monster hunter players however, don't care about the story (story =/= lore btw) and just want to hunt old and new monsters. So having to go through hours and hours of dialogues and cut scenes just so that you can hunt 1 monster is very irritating. At least world's story has some good memes.


I could go on and on and also talk about weapons and some other things, but I think I got most of the points and what I wanted to say across.

All in all, I'd say the game is pretty good in terms of gameplay. The loop however, is quite lacking due to the bad end-game. As of writing this review, I sadly can't recommend the game to anyone as it feels VERY rushed and incomplete. Here's to hoping the TUs are good and not just one monster at a time.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198137768964/,"This might get drowned out by all the reviews about performance, but there are many issues I had with the game past that.

Difficulty:
I used pc controls and the lance for the first time for my playthrough and didn't even need to craft armor until Guardian Doshagama, going from 11 defense to 131. From there it was a cake walk just by using what random materials I had from doing quests, even beating a tempered Arkveld right after beating the main story with no problem still using random bs. I understand wanting to make a game accessible to all skill levels, but doing it to this degree gives most players no reason to interact with the open world at all during the story, and considering the lack of postgame, basically invalidates the open world as a whole.

Weapon and combat changes:
Counter reliance is bad for monster hunter, and every weapon has some form of counter in this game, with certain weapons revolving around spamming counters now. Plus, certain overtuned attacks have made some weapons lose nuance in gameplay, and in conjunction with wound attacks, makes the combat feel really spammy. Also, the combination of wounds, clashes, and offsets really thrashes the monsters around, making even returning threats feel more pathetic than ever. The majority of combat changes seem to prioritize making the game more cinematic and satisfying over giving it mechanical depth, which I can enjoy for one game, but I hope that design philosophy is a one time thing. [Additional minor nitpick: what kind of logic makes wounds go away when you hit them, and makes it so you can only do certain combos if you start them by hitting a wound?]

Content and pacing:
I beat every main quest, side quest, and monster available at launch in 27~ hours of gameplay, and I wasn’t really in much of a rush. What’s arguably worse is that you pretty much fight the final boss in low rank, and the entirety of high rank feels like postgame, with its final fight being a rematch from low rank. Then, there is basically no actual post game other than fighting a handful of tempered monsters harder than what you get from doing the main high rank quests.

Monsters:
The new monsters are fine. Since it's a subjective topic, all I care to mention is that the movesets of some seem shallow, and many of their moves plus the new moves given to old monsters seem poor at indicating the direction and space they’re gonna take up. I also think they lack the charm found in many classic monster hunter monsters, but that can be applied to monsters from rise and world as well.

The environment:
It's decent, which is devastating in comparison to how amazing the locales were in world. Not including graphical issues, it can be ugly and dark and boring at times, but can certainly be beautiful, especially in the ruins. However, the level of creativity pales in comparison to the fantastical coral highlands and rotten veil. Even the clever use of every single imaginable shape and form of ice in the hoarfrost impressed me more than anything shown in this game. Plus, the endemic life was kind of lame, with many of them being slightly altered, real world lizards. Also, having to catch something for a quest that I already caught previously was annoying.

My general opinion:
This game is deeply disappointing to me, not because it's objectively bad, but because I expected much more. It seems like they learned from the feedback given to world, but forgot a lot of what they did to make that game as good as it was in the first place. Also, as I was playing, many aspects of the game seemed like a collection of many good-but-underdeveloped ideas, lacking the depth and attention to detail I was looking forward to from this team. Aside from negative feelings, I was able to make a decent amount of fun of it, but cannot recommend buying this game before beating the majority of worldborne.",Not Recommended,3208,117.4 hrs on record,Posted: March 2

Skyblade799,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Skyblade799/,"BIG UPDATE:
IT'S NOT WORTH THE PRICE: IT'S SHORT. IT'S REALLY SHORT (and easy)!

I didn't expect that, but I beat the game having left it up for at least 5 hours, and 16 hours of those were low-rank/campaign cutscene heavy play, leaving around 19-20 hours of actual gear grinding and monster fighting, but with almost none of the decision making I would expect for the gear.

It indeed is very easy too (just as others said it was); I've beaten every boss in the game and only maybe have a few tempered enemies less to beat, and I've carted/died maybe 3-4 times? There's not much reason to grind except to pass the time (which I probably will just to get the money's worth), as with a max tier hammer AND dual blades already equipped as of beating the final boss, I would just be grinding for random decorations and the goofy ""Artian""/ random weapon stat parts system for the hell of it - not because there's any actual progression left. Not like I just rushed either; this is just from playing to get the hunter rank to actually fight said final boss.

I kind of blame this on them putting all defensive jewels on armor, and all offensive ones on weapons, thus leaving nothing left on the armor except stamina/defense/evade window (and maybe the set bonuses I don't have reason to get at this point)? They added weapon swapping, but didn't think through the effects of changing the gear systems so poorly to match.

Even issues from the original review I made (that was under halfway through) still ring true:

1:It's not well optimized. I'm not having issues, but just by looking at my own performance metrics (on a beefy computer) I can see how much it's using up for a game that really, really shouldn't be. It's no wonder many are having problems right now.

2: The UI is awful for no reason. Tons of games have done the MMO styled inventory UI, maps, controls, etc. all better than MH has over the years.

3: the game is terrible for co-op. You have to do some kind of wonky thing where you invite people to a ""link group"", and then to your environment in order to properly quest in the same party/town. It works story quests, but figuring it was is a nightmare, where you need everyone to go enter the quest and go through the cutscenes until it says ""quest started"" and then you need to actually join someone in your link group (abandon the quest) just to actually join them, but it does thankfully count for progress. Seriously clunky.

4: A lot of moveset complexity is missing. No stance swapping or wirebugs from Rise (same with palico skill customization). The weapon swapping is indeed nice and allows for swapping up builds to strengthen the other (like poison application into a weapon swap while it's ticking away), but it's not quite the same thing if you are dedicated to a weapon I suppose, as all that second weapon lets you do then is swap an element and that's it. No extra capabilities or options to freshen up the fights, so every fight feels the same in terms of what moves you make.

5: It's ""open world"", but the campaign is an awful, linear boredom fest with a giant pile of slow auto-walk sections (and I do mean it's actually automatically walking your forwards at a certain speed). Cutscenes I couldn't skip fast enough with character designs picked out of a roulette wheel. Plus, by the time you get to high rank and actually just get to go out and hunt.... if you fight the wrong/higher rank monsters lying out in your world, the game just tells you that ""you can't"" and if you kill them yoi get no quest reward. Why even spawn then in your co-op game if you and your friends can't be rewarded for that yet? Why make it open exploration at all? What does it do other than reduce performance. To make it EVEN worse, I'd argue that the map design is much less well designed and smaller than world for each area, much less vertically capable, and in general just not as good as either. Seems like they focused too much on interlinking everything than they did making it good, which reminds me of that DLC area from Rise that was trying to be everything, but ended up being a bit unrefined.

6: The inventory management is awful. Constantly have to go to the camp box to store excess items, and the game expects you to get them, or else you won't be able to craft anything. No way to auto-send easily like in Rise it seems? It does get sent to your box if you are full on picking up something, but you have to awkwardly go through confirmation prompts and a menu that forcibly pops up every single time you grab something in that case (even when grabbing with the grappling hook), which is bad for the flow of the game.

Compared to the other MH games I've played (World & Rise)? It's a fun game, but It's much less of an improvement than I'd hoped over World. In-fact, I dare say it's actually just a side grade.... or worse. Rise lost a lot of world design but gained a lot of mechanics development... but here, we got nothing really, and some things became less interesting overall. Even rise had many more monsters on release, and rise added a lot of new combat mechanics and features even if added less monsters. This was made in the same exact engine and clearly uses a lot of the same monster move-sets and everything (and doesn't even look great for the performance), so I'm surprised they don't just have more monsters from world in here to help improve the content limitations given they would just need a visual fix-up. I was expecting more with this being a major mainline entry and not the mobile console release rise was, but here we are.

Everything is weaker; the roster, the weapon depth, the armor decisions to be made based on build... even the end grind isn't particularly exciting to think about with no real goals, or even cohesion; my game winning build is 5 evade window and some stamina/recovery up an any hammer/dual blades I feel like, and I just cobbled it together randomly as I played with no thought. The areas are less interesting, there's less depth to palicos/movesets/secret collection... in fact are there even any secrets to find like the little critters in Rise? The few secrets I found just had a lot of random collectable trade items in them, which are only for use in the overly simple cooking buffs (where there's also really no decisions to be made). Man, even the little cooking animations are worse; who just fries a whole quarter of a head of cabbage/lettuce like that and bites it off a knife?

It isn't worth the price; fun, but on a sale (probably for around $30-40, not 70 or higher). If you are planning on playing it regardless of that (or from a later sale), make sure your computer can actually handle it, and for co-op... wait for some guides on how that even works (if at all for the story). A lot more of a mess than it should be right now.

Hopefully some non-DLC updates add something, because I definitely struggle to recommend it if you are here for the gameplay with that practically ""Path of Exile"" level waste of a campaign dragging it down for the first half, and the lack of interesting design or even content in general or in the second half.",Not Recommended,5856,104.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 1
7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198072437110/,"As someone who has put over 5000 hours into this franchise since Tri on the Wii and fully completed every entry since then, I never thought I'd actually have to do this but this game simply deserves a negative review. The state of the PC version alone is already a massive disappointment and personally I have never played a more broken game at launch than this one. Sure, my i7-9700k/RTX 2080 PC is a bit old now but it's still above Capcom's own ""Recommended"" specs and performance that doesn't match the visuals on display is far from the only issue. Textures not loading is a very common problem even among friends with a much better PC and there's a lack of polish overall with bugs like a certain large icy monster spawning in a ""T-pose"" almost every time. To top it all off, Capcom continues to think it's a great idea to burden an already terribly optimized game with DRM to make everything even worse for us paying customers.

That said, I wish the technical aspect was my only complaint but all it's done is make the other lacking parts of the game harder to swallow. Capcom clearly wants that mainstream money now and that goal for mass appeal bleeds into every aspect of the design. The cringe storytelling and the way you're pushed through it to make multiplayer a pain makes for an annoying earlygame but once the dust settles in High Rank you have time to truly observe how far Wilds already is from what Monster Hunter used to be. Monsters - despite their cool new designs - are glorified loot pinatas that are extremely easy to overpower with the wounds mechanic that is way too potent. Veteran players will know about the back and forth ""dance"" you have with monsters while fighting them but in Wilds there's nearly none of that left. Even the loot itself feels as worthless as it ever has. As someone with terrible luck, I was initially happy seeing investigations with guaranteed gems in their rewards...until I realized just how common they are and how a single one can provide 3! guaranteed gems to you and your friends whenever you like. It's all just so meaningless and way worse than the old ""pity"" system where you could trade for a rare part you just can't seem to get with a limited set of tickets.

Then you get to crafting your gear which has some genuinely awesome designs. Mission accomplished, right? Well no, because then you realize how limited you are in this game with skill choice because they split skills into weapon and armor categories. At first I thought this might be a balancing answer to the skill bloat from World/Rise but it really does just restrict you and make things way simpler. Bowguns have it the worst here, being forced to live with ammo capacity, recoil and reload speeds (No, Opening Shot sucks) that I wouldn't have wished on my enemies in past games. This redesign just isn't fun and hurts these weapons way more than just toning down their damage output and looks even more pathetic when compared to some quite frankly insane things the melee weapons get for free in their base kits in this game. Bow may as well be one of them too now, gaining infinite coatings to support the playstyle change started in World from carefully placed charged shots to spamming as many arrows as possible.

Even the food skills have lost a lot of their meaning. You no longer eat for every hunt to accommodate the layout of this game and the skill selection reflects that. Barely any minor optimizations or boosts for the weapon types you use are left and the best sources of food give you access to more loot and free insurance so there's even less risk if there ever was any? Wow, what a deal! Why even bother with anything else? It's fine though, it's not like you can even check what the random food skills you get might do because someone forgot to add a button to look at things in the menus. Speaking of which, I'm still baffled how they messed up menu/UI things they've solved in previous entries. Why are there no damn equipment/item boxes for easy access? Why does it have to take so long to speak to Gemma and look at weapons and why does skipping the only forging animation you've seen dozens of times already take longer than it should? Why is the wishlist so ineffective at highlighting what you're missing in the total materials when Rise had it perfect? These kind of irritations add up over extended play and somehow Capcom didn't notice these flaws in their quest to streamline everything even more.

The world itself is quite boring despite being fairly varied and the cool concept of changing environments. Early on, you have no incentive to go out and explore with the restrictions of the story and because it's simply not necessary to progress. No time to smell the roses, just keep pushing on from one area to the next at max speed. But even later on, why bother learning the layouts when your mount will just autopilot you anywhere you want to go? World's exploration felt more meaningful than this and Rise was a lot of fun to navigate with the Wirebugs.

The soundtrack is quite a disappointment compared to the rest of the series, as even World had a fantastic score aside from the absolutely trash regular quest clear theme. This OST has some moments, but it's all so unmemorable and ambient. The quest clear theme here doesn't even get remotely good until nearly a minute in, so captures will never get there while also being in a game where you can skip ahead. But it all makes perfect sense. Clearing a quest is no longer an accomplishment or special in any way, so the music used reflects that. No fanfare, just go on to the next one with the new skip feature.

Finally, in terms of content there is much to be desired here that's expected of a Monster Hunter entry. The game is basically over in record time after Low Rank, you can't re-fight the ""final boss"" and there's not even a real spectacle/siege fight. Where's my Dragonator?? Where is anything, really? No Ballistas or Cannons, no real Arena or Arena Quests or you know, a multiplayer hub which is only one of the most important things in the series. The fact that they felt comfortable pushing that into a title update says it all, really. The series keeps moving more and more into the ""live service"" territory and I hate to see it when the base game is so barren at launch. In my eyes, the base game should be complete on Day 1 and have next to no title updates to save as much as possible for the expansion but it's too late for that now. Capcom got away with it and will use the title updates to maybe fix/finish the game (hopefully at least one of those) while trying to keep engagement numbers high to boost sales of their stupid cosmetic DLCs before starting the hype cycle for the expansion.

This series is no longer for the people who kept it going all those years and while there is still fun that can be had along the way, it's losing more and more of the essence that made it satisfying in the first place. There definitely are a lot of areas that updates and the expansion can and surely will improve on, but some parts of its overall design just aren't fixable. I still have some faith in the portable team to give us a well-optimized entry for the Switch 2 (that will scale up nicely to stronger platforms) which will at least TRY to keep some of the classic spirit of the series alive just as Rise/Sunbreak did despite their flaws. If they don't, then I'll have to consider replaying older entries (that they probably don't want to remaster either because then they'd have to sell a complete Monster Hunter game with no DLC galore) or just moving on entirely from (what perhaps used to be) one of my favorite franchises.",Not Recommended,6297,149.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 18

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198031953257/,"Monster Hunter Wilds is a great game ... just not yet and hopefully with some updates my review might change.

The Good

Let’s start with the positives. Visually, Wilds is stunning. Its environments are beautifully crafted, and the combat remains impeccable, carrying forward the deep, rewarding mechanics that define the series. The thrill of the hunt is still here, with weapons feeling satisfying to use and monsters providing exhilarating challenges.

The fishing is also kinda cool now. (Yes, that’s actually a highlight.)

The Issues

However, despite its strengths, Wilds stumbles in nearly every other aspect. Performance has been unnecessarily poor for many players, and while optimizations will likely come in future patches, they won’t fix the game’s more fundamental problems. Wilds takes multiple steps back from the series' core identity, creating an experience that is frustratingly obstructive and unfinished.

UI and Navigation

The user interface is a mess. Something as simple as adding a friend without joining the same lobby is an ordeal. The game’s multiplayer is somehow more obtuse than World’s already clunky system, requiring unnecessary steps just to play with friends.

The HUD is cluttered with unnecessary markers and information overload, stealing attention from the world and combat. Instead of immersing players, it bombards them with visual noise that detracts from exploration.

Loss of Core Monster Hunter Identity

Monster Hunter has always been about preparation, scouting, tracking, and finally engaging in combat. Wilds strips away these core gameplay elements in favor of shallow, modern open-world tropes.

Scouting is undermined by objective markers that tell you exactly where everything is, removing the joy of discovery.

Tracking is gone, replaced by an ever-present magic marker that directs you to your target without effort.

Exploration is actively discouraged, as the game yanks you back if you stray too far.

Combat, while still strong, is hindered by poor pacing and an overabundance of hand-holding.

Rather than enhancing the experience, these changes reduce Monster Hunter to a streamlined action game, stripping away the depth that made past titles special.

Low-Rank Experience and Story

Early-game progression is a slog. Hunts are too short, often lasting only 5-10 minutes, making combat feel rushed rather than rewarding. Build crafting has been oversimplified with restrictive gem slotting, eliminating the creativity and satisfaction of optimizing a setup.

The story, meanwhile, is both forgettable and frustratingly intrusive. Unlike World, which gave players room to breathe, Wilds constantly shackles players with excessive handholding, preventing them from engaging with the game on their own terms. The first 10 hours feel like a prolonged tutorial, suffocating any sense of freedom.

What’s Missing?

Many beloved features from past games are either absent or underwhelming:

No home customization

No endemic life as pets

No meaningful mounts in combat

No significant collectibles

No raids

Cooking lacks variety compared to previous titles

These missing elements further dilute the experience, making the world feel emptier and less engaging.

The Verdict

Monster Hunter Wilds has immense potential. Its combat remains excellent, and its world is breathtaking. However, its misguided design choices, frustrating UI, lack of core Monster Hunter elements, and poor pacing make it a difficult game to recommend at launch. If Capcom can address these issues through updates and expansions, Wilds could eventually become a worthy successor to past titles.",Not Recommended,3117,30.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 6
milesxgaming,https://steamcommunity.com/id/milesxgaming/,"Just finished the first hunt and got to the base camp. I'm really enjoying myself. It feels really good, more fluid than world.
In the benchmark and beta, my performance was tolerable, enough that I was worried. have a 7800xt and a 5700x3D. I'm running 1440p on ultra, AMDfsr 3 and frame gen are on, I'm sitting above 100FPS. So far aside from a couple hitches and stutters that I'm pretty sure are cache related, the game is running solid.

HOWEVER, I KNOW that if I didn't have FSR3 and Frame Gen on, I would be struggling to get above 60FPS. These tools should be used so lower spec PCs can get in on the fun and instead they're flat out required to make the game run decently. Why do you think the game literally advises you to turn frame gen on?
Some of the textures in this game look worse than even PS2 era and apparently the high res texture pack causes issues for people with very high specs. The game as a whole somehow looks worse yet better than World. It's bizarre.

The game is demanding because it's poorly optimised. I have no idea why so many are blaming end users equipment - as if PC gamers forgot how to adjust graphics settings over night. Get your heads out of your ass.

Dragon's Dogma 2 was a performance mess. So was Helldivers 2, which everyone seems to forget. Almost every major game release the last few years has had issues (Shout out Lies of P you were so good for that) but because MH is your favourite franchise and it runs fine for you, you blame others. Get your barroth sized heads out of your congalala sized ass.

It's been a staple for years and I am so happy that the gaming audience took note of how great these games can be. It was elevated with 2018's Monster Hunter World and continued to iterate on the franchise with Rise's dog-like companion similar to the sierket you can ride in Wilds.

What I will say about the game;
The game is a loaded die and your experience will very; not because of anything the player can do; but because the developers did not take the time to make this game perfect.

Regardless if you have a high end pc or a low end pc your results will be the same. I've had points in this game where I say this might be the most beautiful game I've ever played to this is the worst looking game I've ever seen. Im running on a high end (3080 ti) on max settings and it runs around 80 fps mostly. Other zones the game looks pixelated; the lighting looks horrendous; and it's unbearable to look at.

The menus are a nightmare. If your wanting to tweak something specific good luck finding it. There's basically 8 pages of menu options that vary. It's impossible to find what your looking for without a guide. Even some of the things that should be simple such as playing with a friend, or changing your title/ Hunter card is buried.

The gameplay is incredible and the only thing that makes this game worth playing. The wounds to monsters are a nice addition to the traditional monster beat em up.

Late game your quests are essentially non-existent and your expected to open the map and choose a monster to hunt; but they don't tell you this. You run into an issue where there are basically no quests left to do except fish a specific fish that only spawns in one location and is elusive to find. It's busy work and makes it unclear if you must do this quest to proceed further. One particular quest I did; would not show me where to turn it in. You had to turn in the quest during a particular time of day; in a certain spot to even see the quest turn in marker.

It's no doubt that Capcom knew this game would perform and look this bad. We called them out during the beta period and they said it was an older build. In good faith I cannot recommend the game at the state it is in. It's extremely frustrating to come off a game like World where it was ground breaking. Then we had Rise which I think was the classic new monster hunter title with a twist (the dog/Sierket) but still niche in low quality (switch only release first).

I have just submitted a refund request for Wilds, as even on fully LOW settings with DLSS performance mode my 3070/Ryzen 7 7800x3D/32gb 6000mhz build is not enough to reach a stable 60 fps in what is genuinely the WORST looking game I have played in recent memory. The game looks terrible. Which is honestly not a deal breaker, but it also FEELS terrible. Constant frame drops during hunts and in the village areas make what is already a poor experience an unplayable one.

jaymga,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jaymga/,"I really wanted this game to be good. I built a new PC primarily just to play this, so I won't speak of the performance issues as they didn't affect me at all. And there were also some positive things that stand out. Weapons feel smoother to play than ever, thanks to focus mode allowing to readjust where you are hitting, being able to skip the quest end countdown is something that was finally added as well, etc.
But even considering that, there are just too many issues to wholeheartedly recommend the game.

My main grievances are:

1. Hunters have too much control. Thanks to the wound system basically adding a free stagger that any weapon can initiate at will so long as there is a wound makes the monsters look like clowns. Hunting Arkveld, the currently ""toughest"" monster in the game, is more akin to watching slapstick comedy. Between wound breaks, offset attacks, power clashes, flashes, regular topples, and natural traps if you use them, the monster spends more time on the ground or standing still than actively fighting. This also leads to hunts rarely taking longer than 10 minutes, usually averaging 7 at most.

2. Monsters are not dangerous anymore. If a monster does actually manage to break out of a hunters CC chain, it is till no threat. Be it the generally low damage of monster attacks, the lack of blights, wind pressure, and god forbid tremor (a literal landwhale belly flop and we don't get tremored standing next to it?), there's nothing a well timed offset attack of guard doesn't solve.

3. You cannot repeat the coolest fight in the game.

4. The absolute state of skills. I think the idea of taking a new approach to weapon and armour skills is nice. But the execution is severely lacking.
Locking certain weapons into a skill that is just objectively unusable on it is ridiculous (looking at you, crit draw lances).
But even if the skill would be usable, it might just straight up not work because a lot of them are bugged (e.g. Critical Element, Burst for HBG, ...). Locking a weapon into a specific skill is too restrictive either way in my opinion, but that's subjective.

5. The artian system feels very lacklustre. These weapons are the best in the game for the most part. The actual look of the weapons is at best mid though, especially compared to the other weapons in the game which are absolute peak design. And even if artian weapons have different elements, they all look the same. The way you build them as well feels very shallow and not engaging at all. It never makes sense not to go for element, there is no downside to just going 3 of the same element, you can't forgo element for a boost in raw/crit/sharpness or whatever. You always aim for the same thing. And when enhancing, you mostly just hope for a bunch of attack. And if you are unlucky, all you have to do is chuck the weapon into the ether and try again.

6. There is basically no endgame grind. The artian stuff feels like it was chucked on at the end just to have an excuse for an endgame. But in reality, parts are readily available from tempered quests that take no longer than regular hunts. If you are not planning on making a weapon of every type and element, you'll be done in no time at all.
Same goes for decorations. It is obvious that the focus of grinding was supposed to be on something different compared to World. This in turn means, that getting all decorations is very quickly done as well, assuming RNGesus doesn't hate you. There is also no new mantles to unlock. You get a grand total of 4 thrown at you during the story and that's it. No doing all optional quests for a new mantle. Nothing.

While writing this review, I realised that some of these decisions may be to make the barrier of entry for new players to the series easier. But I feel like that is no excuse to leave existing fans of the series by the wayside. In World, i really enjoyed struggling with my friends to find a way to beat a certain monster, or a hunt coming down to the wire with 2 unfortunate carts. I enjoyed finding ways to make certain grinds faster with the variety of tools we had at hand. Finding something new to work towards way into the endgame. In Wilds, there's just nothing.

This game left a void in me. I was looking forward to it. I enjoyed playing through the story, albeit it feeling too easy, but I told myself ""Surely it will get harder in HR/Endgame"". And then I get to the end of HR. I beat Arkveld again. I am excited for what is to come when I hit HR50. What fight will be next? Will we get an elder dragon to fight? Zoh Shia again? What are these artian weapons preparing me for? And then ... nothing. I am left sitting in a mountain of unused relics, decorations and artian weapons. Okay, maybe it's HR60 this time around. I check. Nothing. There's nothing else to do. Hunt Arkveld 30 more times to reach HR100 to unlock more melding that I don't even need? That's it. That's the game done.

It may sound like I don't like the game. That couldn't be further from the truth. I still love the game, I see the vision, and I am looking forward to what the game will become in the future.
But right now, I just cannot give the game a positive review. I will revisit this review once we see some more content and these issues addressed.

zebpai,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zebpai/,"Not recommended with its current state (v1.0).

It's a good game (not great). My overall rating is 7/10. Wait until Title Update 4~5 first before buying.
Some points of the review is in comparsion with the base game World and Rise when they were first released.

First thing I'm gonna say is what I really like about the game.
Focus Mechanic - With Focus Aim you can freely aim anywhere now. This helps a lot especially melee weapons.
Offset Attacks and Power Clashes - Great way of parrying monster attacks and addition to perfect guards.
Slinger Gathering - No need to go the herbs and pick them up.
New way of story progression. Not just: Hub - Post Hub Quest - Hunt.

With all the stuff below I hope all of them will get fixed and improve in the future updates!

Game doesn't use the latest DLSS & DirectStorage versions for better and stable performance. For texture loading problems, it's as stated by one of the modders as well that capcom devs avoided using RAM/VRAM by streaming things when needed from storage instead of at boot time. All of these has been fixed by modders. And I hope Capcom will fix this on their side.

There are a lot of QoL improvements but there are some changes that are questionable like the pop-up camps. What's the point of pop-up camps getting destroyed if you just need 75 points to fix them? And with the maps that are much larger than previous Monster Hunter games why not just make all the camps available and not have a limit of five. I do like that you can customize the camps now.




Before with the fixed Hub you always know where to go when you want to do a hunt or do something with the lobby. Because the NPC will not move and the NPC will always be there. Right now at least maybe more than half of the time since your Handler is the same as the Hub NPC, with her coming along with you on hunts, She will not always be beside the Base Camp Tent. She will most of the time walk around the Base Camp and you need to go look for her in order for you to interact with her.


Right now in order for you to get notified, when someone posted a hunt is through link party. Link party is good I'll be honest even when you are not in the same lobby you can still hunt with other link party members. But when you and your friends are in the same lobby and not in a link party there is no other way to know that someone posted a hunt aside from saying it through VC if you are in a call or manually typing it in game.


Back in MH World when we got Layered Armor you could link your layered armor set with the equipment loadout you are equipping. But now in order for you to change equipment appearance you need to get out of the Change Equipment and Navigate to Equipment Appearance. This is about 10 button presses average if your equipment appearance loadout is in the first page. Also for the Appearance Menu, they should move the Change Appearance below the Equipment Appearance because you will not always change how your character(face) will look. When changing equipment appearance, me and most people I know accidentally pressed this most of the time instead of moving down below first. For listed menu designs you will always put first the ones that will mostly be chosen to the least one.

In MH Rise the Layered Loadouts are in the Equipment Loadouts already. Even though they are not linked you can just switch between Equipment and Layered with LB/RB or L1/R1. They introduced Hunter Loadouts in Title Update 4 in Rise though. This is a loadout with equipment and layered link and an additional link for item loadout. This is really great especially for gunners since they have different ammos for different weapons.


There is no Kinsect Tree. In order for you to know which Kinsect is better is after you nurture all of them. Back in World there are three tabs when you are crafting/updraging equipment and raising a kinsect. These are the list , tree and zoom view. Right now the one for Kinsect is default into a list view only.


I get that mantles will continue to cooldown when you are doing a Field Survey but when you are doing a specific quest or investigation from Alma the cooldown should reset.
This specific review is not for everyone. But mainly who do speedruns or testing some things on a specific quest.
The only available option now is ""Return from Quest"" and doing that uses up everything that you did during the quest (i.e. might pill or traps). You need to replenish the items everytime you do the run again. You also need to wait for the mantles to cooldown. Thus making it inefficient to do runs.


This is a simple feature to add and the Copy Session ID was already present in the Communication menu in World.
There was also a shortcut key to view the Player List before in World when view the menu.


The game taught us and it has always been the select key to view the map even from the previous game. In Wilds if there are monster notifications in chat, the select key will be the shortcut to skip the monster and to view the map you need to hold the start key. Every UX Designer knows that this is just bad for ""Navigation Familiarity""


We all know that playing Monster Hunter games is always been the never ending hunting of monsters so I am fine with the story being so simple. I like how the story progresses now than before where you post the main story quest in hub and depart on the quest. I think they are moving close to a RPG type of main story progression with the maps connected to each other. And with locked out paths when you are being accompanied by NPC when you guys are riding a Seikret. And speaking of Seikret...


Seikret AI is kinda junky at the moment. For sure this will be fixed in the future. Palamutes are the best. Change my mind.



Right now base endgame hunting, there is only one monster that is worth hunting with the rewards. And that is mostly Arkveld. For full hunt rewards he will get paired up with a random monster and that is a way for you to hunt a different monster aside from him. Half of my saved investigations are Arkveld since other monsters don't have the same amount of rewards. The other half are those monsters with their Gem as rewards. But if you already crafted a lot of equipments that needs a monster gem. You will just go back to Arkveld.

Back in Base World you could always hunt almost every monster in High Rank since you are looking for Investigations with Gold Rewards and every monster investigation can have that reward. Also why couldn't we fight


Before you could select bounties (optional subquests in Rise) that you want to do while hunting. And then choose a different bounty when you finish them.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198003638963/,"Never in my mind did I ever think I'd have to, at any point in my life, write a negative review for a monster hunter game.
As a disclaimer - I am not a hater. I LOVE the franchise. Started back in Tri, buying the game completely by accident. Just by the art on the cover box, having no idea what I am getting into.

I fell in love with it, despite it's clunkyness and the game doing a poor job of explaining itself, but, by the time I finally fell my first Great Jaggi, I was hooked.
The constant gameplay loop of killing a big monster, to make gear out of it, to prepare myself for yet another, even stronger monster - it's a magical code for my brain that keeps me coming back to this series.

BUT... It's not present in this one. Game has amazing fundamentals. The movement never felt this good. The weapon movesets have never been this fluid.
It's just a shame that all of it doesn't really matter, when the core aspect of a ""monster hunter"" game has been streamlined OUT of the game and now it's just a generic ""monster fighter"".

Where as the series started as a ""hunting expierience"" with player having to commit on every step, because there were stakes - now there are no stakes and no commitment.
Before, you had to prepare your pouch for the hunt, carefully chosing items and stocking up on them. You had to position well during combat, because if you just go out swinging hands, at best you could whiff an attack and deal no damage, at worst you would get punished by the monster and get hit instead (and remember, your amount of potions on a hunt was limited, so you're being tested my friend).

Now, no matter if im running Dual Blades or Great Sword, as long as I am in range of the monster, it's gonna ALWAYS land, thx to the FOCUS mode, which ironically makes your brain lose focus, kinda zone out and let your hands just go through the motions. Feeling like you're fighting on autopilot, completely disengaged.
Add to it the wound mechanic, which lets you stunlock the monster.
The Palico that makes sure you don't have to bring healing items ever again and magically lays down a trap exactly at the moment that the monster is capturable.
All those little things, and suddenly the game fails to provide any challenge.
I could go on and on, but big content creators are finally catching up to what I've been heralding since World came out (because World started the trend, but wasn't nearly as sinful as this is) and they have already said everything.

Mechanics such as wind pressure, tremors, seem to not exist. They probably do but I finished all the content (which is not a lot if you skip all the cutscenes and if you COULD skip all the walkie-talkie sections) and I don't remember wind pressure/tremors or such things happening at all.
Now - before you come at me, I did watch all the cutscenes, I didn't skip a single one of them, but my friend wanting to catch up to me, did, and he finished ""the story"" in 7 hours, where as I did so in around 20, and it's never a good sign if 13 hours out of your entire 20 for A GAME are filled with cutscenes.

I keep seeing these claims of the game's director that MH Wilds is a great success because of the story... No my friend. It's a great success despite the story, and mostly because World was a huge success. You are kind of getting the benefit of the doubt here, but you are quickly burning it.

This game has very little to do with what an actual ""Monster Hunter"" series was always about.
Expierience-wise: It's a game about hunting monsters, and as a hunter, preparing traps, tracking, doing what a hunter does.
Gameplay-wise: Fight a monster, get it's parts, craft better armor, to be able to fight a bigger monster - that is what we would call ""gameplay loop"" in video game design, sadly, it's non-existant here.

Monster Hunter has lost it's soul and it's an extremly sad thing to witness. Because this used to be one of my most beloved things in the world, alongside Zelda, Mario, Metroid, all these big, passion-filled creations. And now, one of them is getting destroyed.

I might stick around to see Wilds getting it's G-rank expansion, but If the series doesn't change the course to revert some of it's streamlining, this might be the last monster hunter game I ever play.",Not Recommended,3492,99.3 hrs on record,Posted: March 22

SZ2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SZ2/,"Let me preface this by saying that the moveset changes to a lot of the weapon and weather effects in the hunt are very welcome additions and really well executed.
As a long time veteran, this is the only pros I can give Wilds sadly.
The game runs like absolute dirt, I had to buy and install a frame generator to almost have a consistent 60 fps with a decent rig (obviously not the best but above the recommended settings). That said, performance, as shoddy as it is, is not why I'm leaving a negative review, the main reason is the hurdles needed to be overcame when playing multiplayer;
This game suffers from, albeit slightly better, issues that Worlds had. If you want to progress the story with a buddy you need to start the main quests (which are mainly an auto-walking simulator while listening to NPCs talk about their lives and the environments, sight seeing and collecting ressources that will never be necessary in the amounts you're collecting (sorry got sidetracked with this other poor design), find the monster you need to hunt and while your buddies do the same, all the other party member beside player one have to run far enough away from the monster to join player 1 in their quest (if the get touched while loading in the player 1 quest, it cancels the loading) AND walk all the way from camp again to find the monster.
The reason I say it's slightly better than world is that at least upon completing that quest, all party member gets the quest completed instead of having to do it for every party members.
Also, finding out how to play with your friends is very convoluted, we're talking 4 different list/lobby than you need to navigate in order to find your friends and even then, you can see each other in the lobby (if you join 2 out of the 4 lists), will disapear to them and them to you once leaving on a quest only to see them again when rejoining the quest in progress after the tedious ""quest prologue"".
The difficulty in this game is also so trivial that you will spend way more time navigating the menus, partaking in the walking sims and watching (or skipping) cutscene than actually hunting monsters.
I'm very confused with the lack of quality control that Capcom have gone away with releasing this title and it pains me as a veteran who want to support them and especially MH.

You literally follow NPCs around, watch cutscenes, and listen to dialogue for longer than the actual hunts last, it's ABSURD.

Shoryuken94,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shoryuken94/,"The game is WILDly underperforming even on high-end hardware.
Frankly, I have little to say that hasn't already been said by others.
Performance aside...

1. There's a strange pivot away from the ""hunting"" aesthetic in this title. There's no more tracking, monsters are always seen on the map and you can automatically run to them (without any input, really). I can appreciate QoL that speeds up the game a bit, but these are key aspects that are required for proper gameplay pacing and made other Monster Hunter games feel the way they do.
2. The game is lacking some serious gameplay variety through features like the Private Quarters (from World). Because the pacing of hunts is already cranked to an all-time high, having nothing else to do makes the game turn into this boss rush with no meaningful breaks. To me this made it much easier to burn out on this game than on World.
3. I wouldn't expect an endgame given that there is no Master Rank yet, but I do want to point out that the game's existing endgame doesn't offer all that much. It's an upgrade from base World's endgame grind, but that's not saying much given how tedious World's was.

Overall, while it's a good new entry in the series, its problems currently vastly outweigh its strengths and I would recommend players to wait for updates. A lot could be done to address these concerns and I have high hopes that Capcom will listen to the players post-launch to release some much needed changes.

If you're still interested in playing the game, I'd say only buy the game if you're very certain that you can run it properly. The Benchmark tool, according to many, is not an accurate assessment of final performance, so do take it with a grain of salt.

Wilds is a fun monster hunter game.

That is unfortunately the only thing it has going for it. The game and gameplay is fun, I enjoy playing it alot and I will most likely spend my time grabbing all the achievements in this game. Gameplay is smooth and for a single celled brain goober like I am, its surprisingly easy to get into and play.

However, for whatever reason, the game runs like absolute dogwater. It is terribly optimized. It crashes frequently. It freezes up my pc alot, and I can't shake the feeling of this game straight up damaging my pc parts by simply running it. I had to install a pair of mods to remove certain processing effects and the like. This has helped my pc not freeze up anymore, which is nice, but the game itself still crashes ocasionally. This game makes every single electronic part in my pc work overtime. I don't understand why, but it is insanely CPU heavy. constantly making it run at 80+ temps (celcius) and ocasionally spiking above 95 and even 100. Sure, these are spikes, ocasional moments of hitting a very high temp, but I believe this can't possibly be normal in the slightest. Wether this is cause my hardware is faulty, or the game is just this ass, I can't answer completely. but with all the other stuff im noting down, I am more inclined to feel it's the latter.

The graphics really don't hold up for me. I find the game not as pleasing to look at. and visually I don't find it stunning or breathtaking in any way. It makes me wonder why the game is so heavy to run anyway. I find the game visually rather ugly. Frame generation amplifies this by another notch but, goodluck runnin this game without it. This is my subjective take though.

With the recent title update, the first free (content) update for this game. I felt the need to post a review. Because the game runs WORSE after it. It stutters heavily, consistently and more frequently before smoothing out after a while. I myself run the game relatively smoothly whenever it doesnt crash or hiccup, but I wonder for how long with how heavy this game loads my pc. I also do not expect Crapcom to even remotely attempt to fix this ""issue"" in the future. I am afraid this is what we will have to deal with.

I do not recommend this game in the slightest for its ludicrous price of 70 euros. (Are we really just gonna increase game prices more and more?) What you get for those 70 euros is a very fun game that functions very poorly. I'd say spend that somewhere else. You aren't missing out on extremely alot here.

As a closing remark I want to let you know that this game launched with a freaking TYPO in one of the config files.

Moopies,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Moopies/,"I love Monster Hunter. World is one of my favorite games of all time. The gameplay in this is good, because it's Monster Hunter.

However, if you aren't already a MH fan - I would stay away:

This game looks and runs like absolute ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Actually, worse. It's pretty impressive that this team was able to take such INCREDIBLE assets like the character models, monster designs, and animations - just to take them all out back, smear them in ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ and weigh them down with stones until they flatten into a miserable experience that is barely playable. With a 4070 and i7 14700kf 32gb of RAM I NEED to use a third party program (shout out Lossless Scaling) to make the game playable on medium settings. It looks HORRIBLE. The textures are muddied over from the (again, necessary) upscaling and everything turns into a ghosting mess. FPS will swing +/- 40 frames when nothing is happening at all.

Making the deliberate choice to use the RE engine for this after the absolutely abysmal ♥♥♥♥♥♥ that was Dragons Dogma 2 is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ astounding to me. The level of disconnect between people who actually played this thing before launch and the reality in which we all live has reached a point that it should be studied by psychologists and philosophers alike as an example of incredible survival within a complete delusion and degredation of the mind. It's an affront to the effot of everyone who worked on rest of the game.

Don't plan on playing this with friends either, the system for joining and creating parties is, once again, a miserable and complicated experience that's buried within layers upon layers of disconnected menus and constantly changing hotkeys, with three different types of ""party"" for you to be in or out of at any time. If you are looking to pull up a friends list, hit ""invite."" and then start playing? Find a game that respects your time in that regard.

I will preface this by saying that I am not a Monster Hunter veteran. My first Monster Hunter game was World. I have only played World + Iceborne, Rise + Sunbreak, Wilds, a bit of MHGU, and have started playing Frontier after Wilds. I think this game is making me nostalgic for a game that I have not played. I am missing the feeling of the older MH games without ever having been an old MH player.

The hunts are fun, but they are significantly less fun than hunts in previous games. They feel just too fast and easy. The monsters just explode and die without ever having the time to present any threat. It feels like the fights are made for people that just want to be told that they won without having to work for it.

The open world part of the game generally makes the maps feel worse than previous games for me. The maps are very big. Moving area to area can feel very slow. It doesn’t even feel like an open world when the main form of transportation between areas is done automatically. The auto run is the default behavior of the mount so I would assume that this is intended experience. I have not internalized the layout of any of the maps because of the autorun feature and I don’t feel a need to. The maps feel like they're on rails because of this. I'd compare moving around the map to moving between the planets in Super Mario Galaxy and you can point your Wiimote at the screen to get star bits.

I really don’t care about the story. I skipped every cutscene and mashed through the dialog. I didn’t care about the story in World either. I didn’t mind it that much the first time I played World but playing through it a second time on PC made me realize how tedious it made parts of the game. Wilds decided to double down on that. I don’t think I would’ve finished the game if I didn’t have the option to skip as much of the story as I was able to. In fact, I wish I could’ve skipped more of it.

The current (launch) end of HR feels very lacking. I know that the game will be getting more in title updates. Arkveld as the last fight in base Wilds feels bad compared to Xeno Jiiva or Narwa. It feels lame that Zoh Shia is low rank only, doesn’t have an armor set or weapon, and you can’t re-fight it. Wilds on launch has pretty much the same total amount of monsters as launch World did, but I think the fights in Wilds are lacking compared to World. It might be because the fights felt way easier. I don’t really buy the idea that the game feels easier cause I’m better at MH now than I was when I first played World because Frontier is brutal. Another reason might be because very few of the fights felt like they had that big fight feel to them. I assume that the apex fights were supposed to give this feeling, but I think most of them failed to deliver on this. Maybe that’s a side effect of having skipped all the cutscenes but I didn’t have this problem with the other games.

Performance issues. Kind of a freebie complaint for PC players. I’m running a 3060 + 5600X and getting anywhere between 30-50 FPS during gameplay with frame generation off. I’d probably rather tank the framerate than turn on frame generation. I really don’t think this game has much of an excuse to run this poorly while looking the way it does. I also wish the game was more colorful. A lot of the areas look really drab in my opinion.

Some smaller nitpicks go here. I’m not a fan of Artian weapons. I’m not a fan of RNG weapons in general. I don’t think I’m a big fan of the new IG. At the very least I like it less than previous iterations. I switched to a controller with buttons on the back to make IG feel comfortable to play.

With things like framegen and AMD upscaling active, its much better, but I don't think we should be encouraging developers to release games in this state and having to use these things are solution to the problem.

In spite of this, while I do enjoy Wilds and will most likely keep playing, I think this game went a bit too far in smoothing out many of the things that gave the Monster Hunter series its charm. While World was responsible for much of the streamlining, it reworked some oldschool mechanics and made them more diegetic (monster investigation level) that gave players quality of life through gameplay and repeated hunts. Much of that is gone here and its pretty hyperfocused on just pointing you at the direction of the monster and letting you fight it. Movesets also got a bit of streamlining and ""jank"" removed from them, and while I personally don't mind it, its also made some weapons feel less like they require a particular ""route"", like Charge Blade. Focus Mode, while nice on paper, has definitely affected weapons differently. Greatsword's True Charged Slash is incredibly easy to land, and lacks much of the commitment it previously had simply because you can aim it if you are slightly off.

Its a fine entry in the series, and it is still very much Monster Hunter, but older MH players may find its lack of edges to be as dealbreaker.",Not Recommended,1377,48.3 hrs on record,Posted: March 8

TLDR: If you want to experience a Monster Hunter game, this is not it. If you want a fun game for 100 hours and don't mind the price, then Wilds is for you.


Important Backstory

There are two core groups of Monster Hunter fans regardless of what point they joined the series;

1) Immersion Hunters. These player value the immersive hunting experience and are largely interested in gameplay elements that facilitate this such as tracking monster, monster behaviours and monster/endemic ecology in the maps.
2) Monster Fighters. These guys enjoy the series for it's unique combat and focus on positioning and commitment once you have pressed a button. Speedrunners are included in this category. They want monsters to be good, fair fights that reward matchup and weapon mastery.

Usually these two groups are arguing with each other regarding which games are good, the immersive lot tend to enjoy World/Iceborne more with the Monster Fighters preferring Rise/Sunbreak, This is a simplification on my part but a useful one at that.



When World/Iceborne was out the players who favoured immersion were happy and the more combat focused hunters from Generations Ultimate found things a little lackluster.
When Rise/Sunbreak came out thew opposite was true.
With Wilds release both groups of players are unsatisfied. The game is missing important immersion enhancing features such as side quests and emphasis on gathering while also missing the difficult but fair combat that made previous titles so enjoyable to replay. I think this can be demonstrated with the reception the game has received from content creators with Ratatoskr representing the immersion fans and others like Juzzi and Mahnster Hunter representing the combat enjoyers.

The amount of side missions in the game is ridiculously little and it's the 1st Monster Hunter I have come across that doesn't have an egg fetch quest, which is a staple any veteran will tell you is in every game. While the game world looks fantastic, the players interaction with the world makes it feel more like a playground instead of a wild ecologically detailed environment the hunter must survive in.
The combat has gutted the core design and left the game easy and shallow. To give you a rough idea of how bad this is IGN detailed the game being too easy as a core criticism of MH Wilds in their review. Imagine that, the game is too easy even for games journalists.



A game getting a larger audience is only good if it doesn't come at the cost of it's core design. The industry has seen many highly acclaimed series end in the gutter due to design decisions diluting the core design to market to a wide audience. Examples near and dear to my heart include Mass Effect, Dead Space, Halo and Rainbow Six Siege. I think this is exactly what MH Wilds has done. It feels the least Monster Hunter out of all of the titles and I forecast the huge influx of players currently interested in the game will lose interest once another large game releases such as GTA 6, this would in theory leave behind the committed, diehard players but these players ironically have been the first to ditch Wilds since it offers none of the experiences they valued from older games. As such once the popularity dies away the remaining community will be a husk of its former glory. The old players have already returned to Rise/Sunbreak and World/Iceborne and new players will quickly ditch Wilds and explore the extensive back catalogue of games including 4 Ultimate, 3 Ultimate and Generations Ultimate.



The issues with Wilds can't be fixed with updates, side quests and monsters can be added later on but this doesn't fix the vast majority of the playerbases 1st playthrough. An egg quest isn't fun when you have already unlocked everything and have 100+ hours in the game. They worked in World and previous titles because they unlocked canteen ingredients and thus gave you a substantial reward. There is nothing worth unlocking like this in Wilds. As for the combat design issues these can not be fixed with newer harder monsters because the monsters aren't the issue. The focus system gutted the most defining feature of Monster Hunters combat. positioning, as you can now guarantee you hit every finishing move or combo. The wounds system also ruins things because it allows hunters to chain cc monsters and spam their most damaging combos. The monsters don't do anything but get cc'ed and die and the exceptions are required to be so fast and hard hitting that they simply aren't fun or engaging to fight against (Tempered Gore Magala). This can not be fixed with additional updates in the same way you can't fix a curry that has too much spice by adding a different spice. The game has overtuned the hunters and placed Capcom in a difficult space, either take away their key combat additions from Wilds or someone magically redesign monsters to account for the new combat mechanics. The former being unlikely due to marketing reasons and the latter unlikely due to financial ones. Capcom can release Giga Chad Rainbow Fatalis or Vibrating Moody Brachydios but they won't rebalance the hunter and return the core combat design that made the previous titles such deep reservoirs of content.



At the moment the Monster count is one of the lowest in the series and the optimization leaves much to be desired. I actually think these issues will get resolved with Title Updates and the Master Rank DLC, it sucks that the game release the way it did but thats an issue with the industry as a whole and not something the devs should be held responsible for. It's not the devs fault that Capcom forced the game to release before the end of the financial year to beef up with profit numbers and please their investors. As a side note the game was originally meant to be released before Christmas 2024 and if you look into the info gathered by r/monsterhunterleaks it's pretty evident that content from the base game was removed and placed into Title Updates.


Monster Hunter Wilds is a fine game, buts its mid. It has diluted the Monster Hunter formula to become more marketable, yes the game is more accessible than previous titles and easier to get into but like most things in life, the very features that make it obtuse are in fact the very features that make it special.

Monster Hunter World is my most played game ever, followed by Monster Hunter Rise. I love these games. Even MHW had teething issues when it first released, and it was eventually improved and I was willing to upgrade my hardware to run it better. Wilds doesn't feel that way because:

1. It just doesn't look good. Textures are muddy and often incredibly pixelated. Hair, clothing, tents, wood structures, you name it, all look like a phoned-in effort at best. Once in a while you see a really nice texture, which only makes the rest look worse.

2. Despite the low quality textures and muddy sheen, performance is miserable. For reference, I'm on a 3080, and no matter what I set my options to, I can't break 60 fps. And once monsters come on screen, or any action happens, it's stutter city.

3. I know Capcom is capable of doing better. MHW and MHR both, IMHO, looked better and performed smoother than this one. It hurts to know they can do so much better, but didn't.

4. Co-op play is only ""sorta"" there. I buy these games to play with friends, and the way co-op works, you can't play through the story with them. You ""kinda"" can, but not really. It became frustrating enough that everyone basically said they'd just play through solo and consider multiplay when they all finish the campaign. Not the worse issue. Just an annoying one.

5. A loss of exploration. They touted that it was a big open world, however it's almost pointless to explore anywhere so far. When playing the story, if you wander too far from where they want you to be, they forcefully rotate your camera back around and tell you, ""no."" They don't tell you where to go, just where not to go. Frustrating.

6. Critics have seemingly ignored all of this. I don't why this bothers me so much. I myself am considering holding onto the game just because I love Monster Hunter so much. But the numerous glowing reviews seem very ""off"" to me for all of the aforementioned reasons.

Your mileage may vary. I wish you luck. If you have beefy hardware with all the framegen necessary to smooth out this mess, then all the power to you.

Look, Monster Hunter Wilds is fun, next gen masterpiece… character creation alone had me lost for hours and the hunts are an absolute blast! but... this game is buried under some of the worst optimization I have ever seen.

What i concluded is:
If you got less than 12GB VRAM, good luck. Hope you enjoy playing slideshows.
You have a high end GPU? That is cute lol. Your RTX 4090 will struggle to breathe, barely hitting 60 FPS at native 4K.
Frame generation is more like Frame Stuttering, nv reflex also chokes harder with stutter frametime and crashes. Lol they expect you to run these games on ai upscaled lmao.
FSR somehow runs better than DLSS lol what kind of unholy magic is this? RE engine is to blame? idk

If you actually want to play the game smoothly, you should try to install Special K because apparently CPU optimizations are optional in this game, use Nukem FG mod because Capcom didnt optimize frame gen properly and upgrade DirectX DLLs manually like its 2005. Also apply reshade because the game is blurrier and color washed than my grandmas old CRT TV. Now i can run 100+ fps, fixing this AAA game with 10+ mods before even actually playing is fun right?

And yes i know some of you will say:
""It runs fine for me, stop playing on a potato PC!""
Me: lol my pc costs more than your car.

This is easily one of the best Monster Hunter games ever, but only if you can actually get it to run properly. If you enjoy spending hours modding and fixing things that shouldve worked out of the box, go for it. Otherwise, maybe wait for Capcom to remember what ""optimization"" means... this game is like a successor of dogma but this time its gpu optimization issue rather than cpu optimization lol. Why are we even here? Its 2025, and were still playing 720p upscaled to 4K like it’s a revolutionary feature.

When they allow it to during different in game 'seasons' colours begin to pop and areas really come to life. Unfortunately due to my settings FSR tends to make textures blurry and muddy, especially at a distance, so until they can fix the absolutely terrible optimisation my game will continue to look like this.

I will update my review if and when fixes come through, the more I look at it, the more I am certain this game was rushed out the door before it was ready.

To be honest, the game is just poorly optimized. I am able to achieve higher than 60 FPS on my own setup without frame generation, but I can still tell something is just not quite right. It runs worse than the betas did, but there's one word that easily explains this.

Denuvo. Denuvo is that word. Why is anyone still using this garbage?

I love what they did with this game combat, most weapons feel better than world. I play bow and the changes to bow were kinda crazy and game changing for me. also, charge blade changes were very cool with the way u get savage axe. I played both of these weapons almost equally and savage axe is so fun to use and a lot of other weapons got a lot of love here, and I appreciate that a lot. that's mostly what the game nails is the way the weapons feel ..

with that being said, the game as a full package is very barebones and rushed compared to base world was its nuts. the roster is ok and most of the bosses have wayyyy lower hp than the norm and die way too quick, fights last 3 to 7mins max and there is zero challenge in this game not to mention some skills like crit elem don't even work like they are supposed to ..

I mostly play this while watching something so I don't fall asleep, if I wanna die in this game I have to make an effort to try to die in a fight also the fact that there is no gathering hub at release is MINDBLOWING also proves that Capcom rushed this game and really wanted to release it before the end of the fiscal year even tho it needed alot more time in the oven ..

Technicality and Performance:
the game looks bad and runs bad seriously it can look so blurry I had the game at +100fps but it stutters from time to time cause its loading in game assets while ur playing instead of in a loading screen (using an NVMe doesn't help) not to mention the implementation of MS directstorage is extremely poor and borked that sometimes textures don't even load making the game look like a ps1 game but somehow looks worse? also the game has a lens distortion effect but somehow its splashed on ur whole screen causing the game to look more blurry then normal which is weird u have to get a mod to fix that .. and it has memory leak there is no reason for this game to be using +10gb of memory when
1-It looks like a ps3 game at best
2-RDR2 a game that looks a thousand times better uses like 6gb of ram ..


STORY:
I had low expectations, but this somehow managed to disappoint me even more its way worse than I thought. don't get me wrong, its a MH game I don't need a good story but it was very Handholdy and very on rails it was a nightmare to get through and finish not to mention joining with a friend was a nightmare and very poorly implemented also the joining was somehow way WORSE than world ever was they made it way too convoluted ..

Gunzelino,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Gunzelino/,"Ever since Monster Hunter World, I was afraid this series would turn more and more into Monster Fighter instead of Monster Hunter. Well, That didn't take long!

The first 20 hours of the game prove once again that this series shouldn't have a story, and has some of the most boring cinematic moments I've experienced in a game. The characters don't have any depth, the overall plot is pretty boring with hardly any consequence, and you just get cut scene after cut scene with railroaded moments in between monster fights.

However, as we all know, a Monster Hunter game only starts when the credits stop, and this is indeed when this game reaches its peak, until you find out there really isn't that much new in high rank and you quickly reach the point of ""that's it?""
That takes us to the combat. Its still fun, but more in a brain dead kind of way. Every generation made the hunter stronger, but now we reached the point where if I'm even using core mechanics and tools that have always been in the games, I feel like I'm cheating. Gone are the days of having to care about positioning, and now I can literally perfect block a super nova with a tiny shield, and counter attack it even too!

The developers spend a LOT of time in building an Eco system and a rich over world, Truly impressive stuff, endemic life that has seasonal cycles of behaviours, small monsters and big roaming around, and yet, this is probably the least immersive Monster Hunter title I have played. All of that fluff doesn't matter when the game play is so simplified and striped of its decades year old mechanics when you just enter a hunt, let the bird take you to a monster, easily kill it in 2 minutes and rinse repeat. At least Rise thought of an excuse to let you be able to see all the monsters on your map. Instead of building/improving those mechanics from older games/World they just straight up dropped it.
There is no need to immerse yourself into this world anymore, learn the maps, learn monster behaviour and such, so why waste the time?

With every Monster Hunter game since World I have to spend an hour or two in the options to customise the experience to my liking, and with every new game, it gets harder and harder to do.


While this review is overly negative, I do still enjoy these games on a more surface level and a different kind of way, and there still is a lot of quality here, like the aforementioned wildlife, Monster/area designs, and the feel of the combat.

There's a great game here dying from lack of oxygen underneath a technical mess that Capcom had to have know about and unleashed on us anyway to meet their Fiscal Year Targets, with no promise of improvements and tone deaf posts about basic PC troubleshooting.

We already knew their new engine hated open spaces (and npcs) from Dogma 2 and some of the design choices in DRDR, but holy hell this is embarassing. I've never seen a game ASK ME TO TURN ON FRAMEGEN BEFORE SHOWING ME THE MAIN MENU. And when you decline, it pops up yet another reminder to go turn it on. That screams desperation to mitigate the known issue.
Aside from fundamental engine problems, it probably can get a tad better like DDogma2 eventually did, and given the lack of complex NPCs, the populatiry and long tail of MH games, and the more barren world I'm willing to bet it will end up better than DD2 once the patching is done.
But we shouldnt have to wait, they shouldnt have chosen this engine without fixing this issue for this use case and THEY ADDED THEIR OWN BAD ANTITAMPER ON TOP OF DENUVO WHICH HAMMERS MY CPU LIKE CRAZY
Why?
Denuvo, you probably shoud consider not doing business with Capcom anymore, like the last time they did this, with RE8, Denuvo will get the blame from technically iliterate people, when performance 'improves' once its removed since like last time they will probably remove their own AT which causes the issues quietly when they do as well.

The textures look bad EVEN WITH 16GBOF VRAM AND THE DLC. And even AT NATIVE WITH DLAA and absolute max settings without FG, which should result in the absolute best picture quality, the image looks soft and blurry. Out-of-focus-like? Something is wrong here. It may be that they relied to hard on taa and even DLAA cant undo that? I didnt driver-force the new dlss4 model, it might help.
Even on a powerful system maxing out the game results in 60-mid 70 fps with some dips below 60. This regularly falls below my monitors VRR range which is really annoying and basically forces FG even on very powerful systems. A VRR monitor with a good window and FG are musts which is really absurd.

I love the game, I will give it a positive review when you fix your performance issues, I'm playing at native resolution no framegen 60 fps on an ultrawide monitor, the issues aren't even really affecting me but it's pretty clear the majority of people do, but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ never put this much focus on the story again because it ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sucks. I thought replaying monster hunter world's story was bad but I don't think I could bring myself to play through this slog again no matter how good the game is and the game is really good, the actual parts where you hunt, but why is so much of the focus in this game on just sitting through dialogue, you're not Baldur's Gate 3, you're not Witcher, play to your strengths instead of this.

Editing the original review, as of the 8th of March, since the latest update the game's performance has gotten WORSE. I had gotten 6 instances of the game freezing for over a second during one mount, the game ran 'fine' before the update (meaning badly but stable badly) and now it is unplayable, good job capcom you actually made the already bad performance worse with updates.

Edit: Right at the end of March, April is tomorrow, Capcom has yet to say anything about any real performance changes and the game still runs like ♥♥♥♥. It's dragon's dogma 2 again.

Edit2: TU1 the performance is still about the same as far as I can see, there's less crashing so that's good, the paid DLC are working but crossplay still breaks multiplayer completely for me so I guess Capcom has it's priorities. Monsters added are cool, however TU1 is pretty much finishing the game and, outside of Mizutsune, is compromised of things that should've been there day 1 like the gathering hub and a high rank version of the final boss, it's not quite as bad as Rise was on release in terms of missing content, but is still disappointing alongside the lacking performance and it is clear to me they released the game because of Capcom not meeting it's financial goal for the fiscal year (which ended soon after the game was released and if you look at their investor meetings, one of the FAQ questions was why not release the game for the holidays season in december, so I'm guessing the release date being this 'late' is a compromise) and only put the game out to fix their finances for the year.

Edit as of the 19th of April, I thought the game was an early release by a month or two, capcom has proved me wrong, this game is more like a year early. Performance is still awful, the multiplayer breaks about 20% of the hunts you enter and their solution to cheaters is to ban anyone who enters a hunt with a cheater (even if they don't realize it) with no plans to do anything about people that get banned by a mistake. You'd think they'd learn after Rise being a rushed title but I guess they're not capable of learning from their own mistakes (you can see that by the UI of this game being in places worse than the 4th gen games), at this rate 6th gen is the last good generation we're getting at all and that's assuming they fix their game before they sell a full priced expansion. I'm on a 3080ti with a 5950x and 32 gigs of ram and the game runs worse than World did on my old 1060 on release.

The hunt gameplay is amazing, and so are the new monsters. Weapons are fun to play, and they kept the ""quick"" gameplay of Rise when you finish most hunts in 10-15 minutes. The monsters are less twitchy compared to Rise, because, thankfully, no wirebugs. Also, the horrible gimmicky bossfights of Rise are no more - here all the leviathans can be perfectly dealt with by normal weapons, with occasional environmental attacks. No rampages, too, which is also great.

Don't believe the people talking about the low difficulty - first two chapters, with 1*-2* hunts are on the easy side, yes, but then the game picks up the pace.

Now, to the bad parts.
They decided to focus on the plot, and the plot is atrocious. 99% of characters are either boring or off-putting. You follow a stupid kid whose growth is sort of focus for the story, and also Alma the guild handler who cant shut up about treating things with respect. You go from one primitive village to another, Alma keeps babbling about how you respect the natives, how local ecology is extremely precious, and how you hunt only to preserve the balance and follow some strict rules or whatever, the stupid kid acts up and says stupid things, and this goes on and on.

Or publishing companies like CapCom will start paying their developers better, extend deadlines on AAA projects to allow developers to focus on efficiency, rather than backtrack to it later when the game is released making their lives worse as they try to correct issues to back-end code on an already live version. Where major changes can't be made easily due to the fragility of the live state.

We point fingers at NVIDIA for their use of AI frame generation on modern cards, we complain that the 30 series cards aren't being supported on DLSS4 and soon 5.

It works like ass, there's no other way to put it. Before the last major update I had consistent crashes after 40-60 minutes of playtime. Thankfully, this is fixed now and I can finally play with textures set on High without having to restart the game every hour. That being said, stutters and pop-ins are still a thing and FPS is all over the place, which is quite impressive considering that a lot of textures look atrocious, and that's on High. I'm not going to download a 70 GB HD pack just so the game can look like it's not straight outta 2008, I don't understand why they had to compromise in texture quality on things like character clothing details instead of some ambient barely-in-view mesh.

Performance aside, the game lacks content at the moment. The new core gameplay is fun and smooth, but there's not much to do in the end game. The game lets you use any armor you crafted as layered armor, but for some reason layered weapons are missing, even though they introduced them in Rise. There's not much customization for your Palico either, and they dropped the whole aspect of collecting different Palicos with different movesets from Rise too. As soon as you're done with the main plot and ""after-plot"", the only thing to do basically is to grind for different armor sets for fashion and roll decorations while hoping for the best, there's not any gameplay loop that gives you any sense of soft progression aside from that.

The game sure feels quite lacking in variety at the moment, even though it didn't shy away from the brand new $70 price tag. With enough time and polish, it will probably become worthy of a recommendation, because the skeleton to support the meat is there, now it just needs to grow it.

The lack of optimisation has made me regret the purchase so far.

So before you buy note:
For some reason, crash reports must be emailed in, instead of auto collected.

Many people crash on start up currently, if not having other compatibility issues. (A chunk of people can fix this by going to your Files > MonsterHunterWild.exe > Properties > Compatibility > Run this Program as an Admin > Apply > Okay > Launch exe from files. Can also try running steam as admin )

From what friends have told me, the multiplayer lobbies is confusing to get to work. Has link party (not actually a link party) and split between many different groups.

CPU usage for a LOT of people is nearing 70+. While mine sits lower, a few of my friends with new CPUs sit at close to 80-90. Enjoy cooking your comp as you play.

As it stands this is a game I'd wait of purchasing until they fix the start up issues. Which is a shame because it's positives make it worth playing.

Despite Monster Hunter being my favorite series of games and how much time I've spent hunting with friends on this game, I can't recommend it yet. I'll start with the negatives for those contemplating this buy, and I'm welcome to change my review whenever optimizations have this game running at an acceptable threshold. I'm lucky enough to have the MH modding community as well as skilled enough to optimize performance on my system which is solidly mid tier, but I feel for the part of the MH community that got locked out of playing this release because I do love the game.

Performance related negatives (These cover essentially the only reasons I don't recommend this game.)
- Frequent stuttering
- Difficulties/bugs streaming in textures
- Crashing
- Poor base performance (Mid-High end systems like the RTX 4070 and above struggle to reach 60 fps without frame gen. This is not ok!)

Non performance related negatives (None of these are the biggest deal for me)
- Some-most monsters are just too easy to abuse so I start to feel bad for them.
- I do miss tracking the monster
- Cats don't cook for me anymore

Positives
+ Best story I've seen in a monster hunter entry in a long time
+ Most beginner friendly base game I've seen
+ Interesting and fun additions to the moveset, offsets make you look badass
+ New content at a good pace
+ Beautiful environments
+ Wudwuds
+ Alma, Gemma, Eric
+ Lots of QOL changes from previous releases (Some I miss, some I enjoy)

Wilds was crazy successful on release, I only dream about how much more successful it could have been if the performance was there.

Game keeps crashing, framerate all over the place, flickering textures, low poly muddy textures, insane amount of pop-in, servers are very slow, out of sync dialogue, NPCs stuck in an animation, boring story and character writing.
Further more, the crazy obsession with zooming in on character models during dialogue and giving you a list of options to pick. Why is this in the game?! i swear it's like they're checking boxes of what is ""trendy"" and just put it in the game. There's so much dialogue bloat and story bits the game could do without and still be a great game. The story progression and dialogue are so bad and annoying. The developers talked about ""more focus on story in this game"".
I say the developers should completely forget about writing stories since they're obviously talent-less and incompetent in that regard. They force you to go ""on rails"" during story progression with boring dialogue and even more boring ""fake"" dialogue ""choices"". They try to mimic the western games style of writing and story design which is horrible, in my opinion. They should focus more on making action cutscenes with monster/hunter fights. They're good with that. And for those who want a story give them a list of lore files to read in-game.

Playing in co-op is beyond frustrating with the new system they have in place. Why change what was basically perfect in World? Joining friends is so unnecessarily complex in this game i hate it!
There's so much hand-holding and tutorials in the game. I get they're trying to draw in the new players, but at some point you should just stop and let players figure things out themselves.

""

1: Seikrets Suck and just auto run to the next destination

2: No exploration needed everything is already discovered on map, half the fun of discovering just gone.

3: Monsters die in 4 minutes

4: More Boring Dialogue than actual hunting

5: Unnecessary difficult multiplayer menu to play with friends

6: No Grind - Monsters drop a lot of Materials, I manged to get enough gear for the full Armour set from the Congalala in one fight

7: Slow Paced, nothing so far has made me feel like i'm on the edge of my seat fighting for my life

8: So far everything is too easy, Not a single feint in any quest nor have I come close.

9: I feel the visuals where the main focus alongside a few new fighting mechanics, Game optimisation, Exploration, Crafting, Grinding has taken a massive back seat in this MH entry, leaving it feeling like half the game that I love MH for.

Conclusion

Boring, Bland and Automated.

Capcom have made this game the most hold your hand snooze fest MH I have ever played.

I write this review as a newcomer to Monster Hunter franchize, I received this game as a gift, for some co-op story play, but that part is poorly implemented. Beyond the lackluster co-op, the optimization and performance are a mess. The game runs terribly, and honestly, it looks dated, especially the textures. But the absolute worst was the completely broken HDR. I couldn't adjust anything in-game. The screen was washed out, and the UI was blindingly bright. I had to manually toggle HDR in Windows every time I played. Dragon's Dogma 2 had the exact same problem, which makes me wonder why Capcom not fixing issues that are know for years. Either they don't know how to make decent PC ports, or they simply don't care. They know their fanbase will blindly praise and buy their games regardless, how poorly their ports are done. They clearly haven't learned anything since Dragon's Dogma 2; the same problems are still present in this game.

Anyone coping this game looks better than World is blatantly lying or has not played World because even at its best (which is pretty much never) Wilds look similar but with washed out colors (HDR might help with that but honestly colors are least of the games problems).
There is no excuse for this to run this poorly as it arguably has worse looking environment than Rise which at least ran buttery smooth (on the same engine btw).
I can run Cyberpunk with raytracing much better than this game and it looks and plays much more smoothly while being much more visually busy.

This is Dragons Dogma 2 again but on steroids as Wilds look barely comparable and performs even worse.

it's fine. the game wrenches control away from me far too frequently. I'm not allowed to go outside of this small line for the first five minutes of every quest because I have to sit through this plot that I genuinely do not care about. there's so many cutscenes and half of them pretend they're not cutscenes so you can't even skip them. every quest starts like the first quest in the wildspire wastes in Monster Hunter World. I RP walk to the area. I sit through conversation. a cutscene happens and monster shows up. I hunt the monster. there's five more minutes of cutscenes and conversations before my next hunt.

I'm here for Monster *Hunter*. and honestly it feels like over half of the game has been conversations and cutscenes instead.

that's not even to begin with my complaints about the gameplay itself. at the risk of sounding elitist, the combat is too easy. I've mained greatsword every game I've played. the key part of the weapon is that it's risk vs reward. I have to commit to an attack that takes a long time, but in exchange I hit really hard. Wilds takes away the risk. if I aim the wrong way, I just hold the focus button down and spin to face the monster instead and hit anyway. the balance is out of whack because of this. the game doesn't have to be hard, I can accept it being easier. but when the fundamental basis of the weapon has been removed, it just doesn't feel good anymore.",Not Recommended,1177,48.4 hrs on record,Posted: April 5

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199039893492/,"Since the beta release, the game has been a disappointment in terms of performance and optimization. Despite high expectations, it suffers from severe technical issues that significantly impact the user experience, making it barely playable.

One of the most noticeable problems is the inconsistent frame rate. Even on high-end systems, the game experiences sudden performance drops without any apparent reason, leading to a frustrating experience. While the situation is slightly better on consoles, it is far from ideal.

Additionally, the lack of proper graphical optimization is alarming. Despite not offering groundbreaking visuals, the game demands excessively powerful hardware to run stably. Issues such as stuttering, screen tearing, and delayed texture loading are constant, highlighting poor resource management. It is unacceptable that, in 2025, a game with such a large budget and extended development time still suffers from graphical issues that should have been fixed before launch.

That said, the rest of the game is exceptional. From the moment you start, it's clear that you're about to embark on an extraordinary adventure. This title masterfully combines fluid gameplay, an exciting combat system, innovative mechanics for a Monster Hunter-style experience, and an engaging story, resulting in an otherwise outstanding game.

In conclusion, this is a prime example of how poor optimization can ruin a product with great potential. Until the developers take serious steps to improve performance, it is difficult to recommend this game at this time.",Not Recommended,1339,116.0 hrs on record,Posted: March 1
holdenmcclure,https://steamcommunity.com/id/holdenmcclure/,"While the vast majority of negative reviews speak exclusively about the poor performance, muddy monotone visuals and terrible UI, they haven't even begun to plumb the toilet that is this launch.

Easily the worst roster ever. Arkveld is a great fight, but he cannot carry the rest of the cast on his shoulders. Setting aside the low rank training wheels creatures like Chatacabra and Quematrice, almost all the new monsters suck. Uth Duna and Nu Udra are pushovers and feel like midrank monsters that were inexplicably shoved into a bracket they don't fit in. Rey Dau is alright. Jin Dahaad is pretty standard gimmicky lumbering Elder Dragon fare. Zoh Shia is inexplicably absent from high tier despite being an interesting fight. Gore Magala is great and challenging, but for whatever reason he's tiered below Arkveld despite being by all accounts a more dangerous creature.

Ajarakan stood out to me as an interesting fight, but unfortunately he's languishing in the middle range. I would have liked to have seen him quirked up and juiced to give the terrible end tier of monsters more worthwhile fights. Xu Wu, Hirabami, Rompopolo, Nerscylla and all the other mid range monsters are forgettable and too easy to be worth remembering.

We get it though, they can't all be winners, but unfortunately we don't have a stock of old reliables on deck like Tigrex, Diablos, Rajang, Jho, Zinogre etc. to lift this terrible roster out of the mud, and they don't really have a great excuse for why. The roster being so small, and with many monsters lifted near 1:1 from World, why not give us a bit more to eat with the most expensive Monster Hunter to date? I'm having trouble understanding what I'm paying for.

The ""campaign"" is the worst in Monster Hunter to date. Low rank monsters are made of paper and the ""story"" is filled with slow walk sequences and hold ""LT"" to look at flora and fauna. Somewhere around the time the Hunter's Guild was explaining to the village of nondescript ethnic village people what a ""weapon"" was I tuned out, but needless to say this system should NOT replace the traditional guild hub and guild quests that characterized Rise and Pre-World Monster Hunter. The narrative driven goyslop enthusiasts have a wealth of AAA slop to choose from and at the very least it could be handled like Rise where village quests and guild quests were partitioned separately.

The difficulty is way, way too easy overall even once you leave low rank. Believe it or not this game has 3 different concurrent ""challenge"" tier monster systems. The new Guardian Wyverian Milk Monsters (yes, that is the terminology), Tempered (from World), and Frenzy from 4U. Guardian and Frenzy only applies to like, 3 or 4 monsters each, but Tempered can apply to all monsters. However Tempered monsters barely feel any different than regular monsters, and assuming you spend even a small amount of time crafting armor and weapons to parity with the tier you're in, Monsters will die faster and deal less damage to you than ever before, and if you slot in Divine Blessing and use Armor Spheres you'll see endgame tempered monsters struggle to shave off a quarter of your health with their strongest moves.

Unfortunately due to the steam review character limit I can't go on, but suffice to say this is the worst showing in a long time. Arguably more disappointing than Dragon's Dogma 2.

akm360,https://steamcommunity.com/id/akm360/,"Pros (and Cons) -

Game looks absolutely gorgeous on ultra 1440p. (needed to buy a new pc to actually run it so that it actually looked good, it looked like a ps2 game on my old pc)

Tons of new QoL features makes the game more friendly to first time MH players (but they removed a fair bit of minor QoL improvements that existed in World. Some UI decisions just make zero sense, it's menus within menus.)

Regional pricing meant the game only cost me 56$, thank you capcom. (horrendous optimization meant I needed to spend 3500$ on a new PC, screw you capcom)

Combat feels better than ever, most weapons were buffed compared to World. Thank you for buffing lance and making it more fun to play than ever. (focus mode is pretty much mandatory on most weapons, its annoying to keep adjusting aim like you're playing an FPS game especially on controller.)

Multiplayer has been made simpler with the Link party feature, playing with friends has never been easier (except now because they added 3 other layers to multiplayer that just serves to cause a lot of confusion on which the best way to connect with someone is.)

Conclusion - Game is amazing, horribly optimized but still fun to play.

entertainementforbaldpeople,https://steamcommunity.com/id/entertainementforbaldpeople/,"[paragraph about the terrible optimization]

the most ""ok"" entry in the series yet!

to start with the positive, this is by far the most fun every weapon has felt in series, each of them having at least a few new moves, and some enhancements to their kits, which makes every weapon incredibly fun to experiment and learn with.

all of the new monsters are rad, alongside the newly introduced octopus-type skeleton which are great addition and hope to see more of at some point.

the weapon designs are great, i don't think there's a single truly boring looking weapon in the game. also applies to some armor.

and that's about it for the positive.

the story is boring and uninteresting and yet they decided to make it one of the centerpoints of the game, requiring you to follow uninteresting npcs with uninteresting dialogue, this also means that, just like world, you're forced to sit through all these boring ass cutscenes before you can even try to play with your friends which renders the entire experience frustrating.

the hunts themselves tend to be extremely easy. not only did they nerf stun for some unknown reason (so far i've only been stunned twice, once in low rank and another in hr 30 or so), the new wound mechanic is comically easy to abuse, not only do you get to deal massive damage, get free materials, you also get to completely interrupt and stagger the monster for a few seconds, drastically reducing the challenge in just about every single monster in the game. thanks to this mechanic i've yet to triple cart on my own, see a triple cart online, or even get a hunt that goes on for more than 20 minutes.

iceshard cliffs is a terrible area only built around having your moron bird auto-move around it, ruins of wyveria is a boring area with nothing on it and a 3 minute run back to the boss should you faint to whatever guardian you're fighting which probably spawned at the bottom with no camps near. windward plains' weather system does nothing except maybe spawn rey dau or arkveld in it, which you probably have an optional quest to fight them anyway.

the dual weapon system is practically useless unless your gear just so happens to benefit both weapons you're currently equipping, which is not often.

the game is really fun but it's 100% not worth the current price tag, and i doubt the free updates will do much for a lot of the issues the game currently has. wait for a sale or for dlc to drop for something interesting to do beyond farm
the same 5 tempered or frenzied monsters for 200 hours.


tldr: game's fun but not fun enough to warrant a 60 dollar price tag for what little (90% of it being easy, the other 10% being kut-ku) content there is at the moment.

kyllercem,https://steamcommunity.com/id/kyllercem/,"70 euros for this game is a robbery

Abysmally low Large Monster count (29 total), one so low that I'm completely done with the game's line-up, Tempereds included
Armors are very unbalanced, currently there's armors where you'd wonder why you would ever run anything else (Arkveld armors especially, you get Weakness Exploit, Flayer & Partbreaker & still have space for Charms)
every Monster in this game is capturable and outside of two Monsters ( every single one of them is trivially easy: so easy to the point where I've carted five times total. I remember it's five times because they all came from those aforementioned monsters in tempered form. Eitherway, I don't need to finish these difficult fights because they both are capturable, making me potentially skip two entire encounters.

They show this game has the potential to actually make fights where the Monsters aren't powercrept by all the new utilities & moves the players were given, but 2 out of 29 fights that are truly enjoyable is not something you can justify paying 70 Euros for.
I dislike the whole ""casul"" Reddit ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ you hear in discussions about games like Dark Souls for example, here it does feel like this game has been notably dumbed down for a broad audience. This isn't a jab at all the QOL they added, in fact those changes are very welcome, however you don't really need to grind Monsters like you used to for armor, you don't really need to position yourself effectively to deal damage because of Focus Mode, you don't get flung up anymore from people using uptilt-type moves (even though they still kept in the fact that you can get flinched by a Longsword user, for example...) and you can't even mess up enviromental traps anymore, since they give you the ability to hold onto it until you see the Monster perfectly align itself to it, as if the game is beckoning you to just Pwess Dee Buddon.
A lot of the times I feel like this game does not treat me like I'm smart enough to solve a hurdle, so it just lowers it.

Let's talk about the gameplay-elephant in the room: Focus Mode & Wounds
Wounds are broken beyond any common sense. Most weapons, if not all, trigger flinches and potentially topples solely from Focus Striking a spot you've swung at the past 15 seconds (which isnt difficult as I established already, since Focus Mode does all the aiming & positioning for you. Yes, on most weapons Focus Mode magnetizes you towards the Monster or enables specific move variations that make your character step forward.) and leads to further Wounds and further topples and potentially even upgrades in your hunt, Savage Axe mode or Switchaxe meter or LS spirit meter etc. . These wound pops are just fundamentally breaking the game to the point where each hunt is a 10 minute long Lab Session where you can wail on a recovering Monster for the entirety of the runtime. These need to get nerfed, Focus Mode makes it impossible to whiff important moves like True Charged Slash or Super Amped Elemental Discharge and Wounds just give you too many DPS phases where hunts end way sooner than they should.

I think if you've played any MonHun game before this this game will be too trivial for you and you will not be getting the same endgame experience as any other game in the series. If you are brand new to it, give it a shot only in a sale. I don't think this game, in its current state, is worth the asking price to any consumer.
Personally, I've clocked a lot of time in these games, specifically a decade's worth, so take the ""this game is too easy"" talk with a grain of salt from my end. I would not be writing this in here, however, if it was just me saying this game is too easy. I have friends who started in the previous games, World and Rise, ones who got bashed for making the series easier by diehard fans. They also say this game is trivial! So if the nu-guys who get bashed for starting at the easy game call this easy, then how bad is it, really?

Now, you probably wondered why I said ""gaming-elephant in the room"". Well, there's another. There's two elephants in that room, one is relevant when you play the game, the other is relevant about running it.

I'm sure you've heard of it, this game runs like ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. The anti-tamper is to blame but the frame-gen debacle is unavoidable. Well, I'm not going to feed into the echochamber, we all are aware this is problematic. I just wanted to write this little paragraph to acknowledge and to remind you, yes this is a huge problem and it might just lead to you being unable to run the game.

Wilds does do a lot of things right. Such as, layered armor sets for fashion, good looking armors, the new monsters are fun to fight, the underlying lore of the series is touched upon more than most other titles. I'm actually struggling to think of more positives.

I find myself having to stop trying to list the negatives as there are so many for me, such as: Hunter power is extremely high and hunts don't last long enough to enjoy the new monsters. Artian weapons are ugly for some weapons with no option to transmog. No rainbow pigment for armors after clearing all optional. No monster hunter language for all dialog. No arena quests (will change with TU1). Only one 8* quest in the game and it's just tempered arkveld (Will change with TU1). Online lobbies are needlessly complicated. Investigations have a low number of uses. No honing system to refine end-game equipment. Gems don't feel meaningful anymore when they can be handed directly to you from an investigation quest. Small monsters are a bigger threat to my sharpness meter than to my hp bar. Heavy bowgun has a free shield for no sacrifice of damage. Game performance leaves much to be desired. Nata is incredibly annoying in terms of both the plot of the game and as an npc that sits outside of my tent. No high rank Zoh Shia (Will change with TU1). Monster roster feels smaller than base world. No subspecies (or lack of main species in some cases). No launching teammates online for random mount situations. You provided a skill to disable friendly fire of teammates but nerfed what teammates can even do anyways. Artian system almost entirely removing the need to craft conventional weapons after a certain point makes it very unrewarding. Palico is far too strong in a support role in this game handling all of the jobs that the previous Palico had to specialize into (Yes I know I can leave my cat behind and I do). Mantle global timers not restarting on quest start hurts speedrunners but also the corrupted mantle is insanely strong and should never have existed. Npcs offering a meal and then not offering it when you show up. The wound system as a whole allows way too much bullying of a monster to knock them over for free. It's very difficult to get stunned anymore, where's the punishment for mistakes??? Hot/Cold drinks are almost pointless to have in this game when the nearest wall will likely have a hot/cold mantle bug. You can't get lost in high rank when starting a quest either for a not-so-secret area or directly in front of the target monster. I really could go on but this is too lengthy as is.

Some of these issues will be addressed in future title updates but the formula has been sanded down so much to the point that it makes me want to play older titles to have more fun. The reason I personally dislike the side titles like rise or generations is that they are extremely easy and try to push the power level of the hunter into the extremes. Wilds is now following the same trend. I have been playing the series since freedom unite and this review is my personal opinion of the game as it was sold to me. If I feel any different after title updates I will gladly change this review.",Not Recommended,2801,289.4 hrs on record,Posted: March 31

I booted up Monster Hunter: Wilds hoping for adventure. What I got instead was a $110 existential crisis wrapped in midcore grainy graphics and the foul stench of corporate greed.

This game is a masterclass in missed potential — a reminder that the modern gaming industry is less about crafting magic and more about monetizing misery. Playing the game feels like watching your childhood dog get rebranded as a blockchain asset. There’s a hollow soullessness baked into every pixel, a kind of ""We made this in a boardroom using words like 'engagement funnel' and 'live service pipeline'"". It’s not a game — it’s a powerpoint deck with a shaders (that take forever to load).

The combat feels like it wants to be fun, but fun died three industry trends ago. The UI/keybinds/menus are so unintuitive I find it hard to believe a human was involved in their making at all. If humans are responsible for this travesty then they are the most grossly overpaid and incompetent group of hamsters on a running wheel that has ever and possibly will ever exist. The monsters themselves? Gorgeous — like seeing your own reflection in a puddle of vomit. The world is vast and open, but so is my refrigerator at 2AM, and both experiences leave me equally empty inside.

This isn’t disappointment. Disappointment is when Taco Bell gets your order wrong. This is the emotional equivalent of catching your parents selling your childhood toys on eBay to fund their NFT collection. It’s the kind of letdown that makes you question if you ever really loved gaming, or if you were just a fool with too much hope.

At this point, I’m not even mad at CAPCOM or the Monster Hunter: Wilds team. I’m mad at myself — for thinking the modern gaming industry was capable of anything other than creative necromancy. My love for gaming? Shadowed. Buried. Possibly taxidermied and posed in a battle pass menu. If this is the future, maybe it’s time I touch grass, read a book, or finally learn how to bake sourdough.

Really sad stuff. Not just for Monster Hunter, but for all of us who remember when games used to feel like love letters, not tax write-offs. Maybe it’s time to walk away. I hear knitting is nice.

On top of all that the cheating in this title is rampant and clearly seen thanks to arena times (you can also look at someones hunter card and see armor with all slots for jewels filled with level 3 decos) and if Capcom tries to fix this by pulling that BS Take Two is doing with there EULA or implement a kernal level anti-cheat like Easy Anti-cheat or BattlEye. Those ""solutions"" doesn't allow any Mods like ultra widescreen mods so I can use my whole monitor i payed a ton of money for. This game that was made by who know how many developers at a multimillion dollar company is limited to the 21:9 aspect ratio and cannot properly do 3440 x 1440 or 5120 x 1440 unless modded with REFramework, but Clair Obscur: Expedition 33 was made by 30 core developers and has ultra wide support. Side rant they took the drunk animation out the game that has been in the last 4 or 5 monster hunters what the hell capcom.

Moving on to performance, this game runs like garbage on PC. You will need a top of the line PC to play this game on high with 60 frames and you will probably get big drops in frames like I do. I usually get anywhere around 60 to 80 frames( on a good day) on a 4k ultrawide monitor depending on what area i'm in with settings on high except ray tracing and frame generation on (btw I have a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 4080 super). I also get a huge drop in frames in the Grand hub at times but fast traveling somewhere else fixes that. I haven't seen the vram usage drop in the first title update (the actual game uses less vram but ""other applications"" are now using more for some reason when no other applications are open or running in the background).

Moving on from performance to gameplay and story, and If your new to Monster Hunter this one is definitely a good game to start the series. The story is not great but had some cool moments. The parts where you have no control were aggravating alot in low rank, and anytime Nata was on screen I wanted to turn the game off. The end of high rank was badass, but i have some favoritism towards it because i played the hell out of MH4U( and Tri so hurry up and bring Lagiacrus back). Also I think Zoh Shia should have been in high rank at launch because now it feels like he is taking a spot in the title 1 update from another monster. The actual hunts feel easier than other titles but keeps the feel of Monster hunter pretty well and all the different weapons feel so damn good and satisfying to master; that I have a build for almost all of them and usually in older titles I picked a weapon at the start and stuck with it(for the most part). For story this game is a 6.5/10, but who really gives af about MH's story. Overall the gameplay in this game is a 9.5/10.

Something is wrong. I drop to my knees in anguish adjusting settings until it's tolerable and thrashing in bed over what could have been.

I have always played greatsword. I am by no means a veteran as I started with WORLD, but after Rise I went back and tried Frontier Z. Even still, this game is piss easy, the ability to micromanage your attacks may seem like a QOL improvement, but I think the identity of mastering your weapon and the knowledge of different monster attacks is completely lost as this series goes on. I felt this a little in Rise with wirebug moves allowing so much freedom but this game I find the offset move for the greatsword to be an everything button whereas a parry similar in older games would not accomplish so much. Offset does too much damage to not just spam, while having incredible upward reach. I'm not sure if other weapons feel this repetitive but the dance and mastering of any monsters moves and your own weapon feels pointless as I could do the same thing in front of literally any monster with similar success.

On top of all this the story still fails to be anything worth watching with my eyes or listening to as everyone around you, their only point of existence is to whine about something that's happening or be dumb enough or air headed enough to run into a monster just for you to save them and move the plot along.

So why the negative review?

Here's why:
Motherboard: Asus TUF X870 Plus
GPU: Astral 5090 OC
CPU: AMD Ryzen 9800X3D
RAM: Kingston Fury Beast 64GB DDR5-6000
SSD: Kingston Fury Renegade 4TB NVMe PCIe 4.0

130 hours spent in-game with no problems, then the Blossom event goes live and I can at best do one maybe 2 hunts if I'm quick about it, but most often I crash mid hunt or on the rewards screen, how does someone even manage to break the game so bad that it can't run on a PC like mine?

Capcom I hope you use some of your budget on stability testing before pushing an update, but so far I've seen no evidence of that considering my parts aren't exactly low end and now they can't even run this game.

And it's not limited to hunts, I've crashed on every menu, situation and screen: Selecting a save file, loading, paused, prepping for the hunt (eating, restocking, equipping another build), mid hunt, rewards screen, standing idle in the hub and I even crashed just opening the game once.

I've tried all the things on Capcoms own trouble shooting posts and a few on Reddit, deleting the shader cache seemed to work a little but at most I got 10 more minutes and another ""compiling shaders"" between 25 minute sessions.

I've even tried blocking the shader compiling and that kinda worked, but the game became a slideshow that wasn't playable, you could brute force your way through but anything requiring timing would be a game of chance.",Not Recommended,1474,134.1 hrs on record,Posted: April 30

Gameplay Issues: In no particular order of importance
-Button Bloat: aim the slinger, aim the precision strike thing, a bunch of random Seikret (the bird mount) commands on top of regular keybinds for the weapon and different menu types.
-Loadouts: Equipment Chest is only accessible through a tent (tedious little mini cutscene) instead of just sitting out in the world
-Quest Board: The quest board (for the story) is attached to an NPC that moves around and is not reliably in the same place, there is no static quest board in the story.
-Quest Lady: The quest lady just sits on the bird mount in combat, just afk as complete chaos unfolds. Kind of breaks the immersion of the chaos of a hunt when quest lady is just chilling during a huge explosion.
-Terrible Button/Default Configs: the Seikret (bird mount) can handle well, you just have to turn off every single setting this is on by default. Keyboard default keybinds are atrocious.
-Personal Take on Mounts: I don't like the Seikret, it de-emphasizes character movement which I feel is a core part of monster hunter, being a super human wielding unwieldy weapons and traversing hostile environments with huge leaps, swinging vines, and launching platforms feels much more satisfying than riding on some mount. I can understand using it in master rank end game as you just want to get to the fight. But these mounts need to be scrapped for low rank and high rank. There is so much to appreciate about level design and points of interest that is wasted on players just defaulting to the auto-destination mounts.
-Personal Take on Decorations: this should be a mechanic they experiment with next instead of more temporary gimmicks that get scrapped in the next gen.
-Story is notably bad. All of them suck, this one sucks and rushes you around. 'hey here is a new zone, quick kill this, great we are saved, oh look new zone, quick kill this, ad infinitum'. It at least felt like you stuck around in one zone for a few, maybe several quests and you get time to memorize some of the zone. This one is like whiplash and you dont get familiar with zones at all (not helped by the Seikret de-emphasizing movement, see earlier point)

Gameplay Nice Things:
-Added radial menu that chooses optimal healing/attribute healing (not great for peak performance users but good nooby radial). Example, I have waterblight, go into radial menu and on the right side it has already chosen the cure I need.
-The new monsters are pretty cool and the sound design on some of them is fairly unique and enjoyable
-Some other small stuff...

It kills me because some of the new mechanical changes like focus mode and wounding? Really cool. But this has come with numerous questionable to outright bad choices.

-Multiplayer setup is a huge pain. What's this environment link nonsense about? Let me just invite people to a team. Also, why do we all have to see the cutscenes for a quest before we can co-op it? This was dumb in World, it's still dumb here.

-The open world aspect feels largely unnecessary in a game where exploration usually takes a backseat to hunting monsters. It also does the game's performance no favors. The RE engine struggled with Dragon's Dogma 2, and it's struggling just as bad here.

-Visually the game is quite underwhelming considering the hardware demands, especially when compared to something like Indiana Jones and the Great Circle.

-Way too much on rails stuff for my liking, where you have to go down a set path and can't deviate from it until the hunt actually starts.

Again, this all is quite a shame because the actual mechanics behind the weapons and the hunting itself? Fine. Bow in particular has become a new favorite weapon of mine when I only touched it casually in the past.

All in all, it feels like Monster Hunter with stuff nobody asked for. In trying to bring Monster Hunter into AAA territory with an open world, big story presentation and narrative focus, they kinda forgot what we're here for at the end of the day: Hunting big effing monsters.

All in all, Monster Hunter: Wilds defaults into a game of the year contender as every other game developer seems to entrenched in DEI culture wars, hating their audience, and brain drain from short-sighted layoffs from poor leadership decisions. Capcom typically referred to as Crapcom has super de-evoluted into Cashcom. With the fundamental issues steming from performance, optimization, and gameplay bugs forgone they decided to launch the game anywhere from 6 months to a year too early to reach their end-of-fiscal-year targets. Is it short sighted? Yes. But do they care? Apparently not as long as their shareholder get their short term profits. This game probably would have probably hit 2 million concurrent players on steam if it wasn’t marred with significant technical issues. Crapcom has cashed on consumer good will which they partially burned through from Dragon’s Dogma 2.

We run into the issue of Crapcom gas lighting you on game performance every step of the way. With information hidden on PC requirements leading up to launch dev talks and severely misleading benchmarks. Every graphical preset in the game has upscaling required. The game even asks you twice on start-up if you want to turn on frame generation. It’s a frame smoothing tech synonymous to motion blur and not real performance with very noticeable visual artifacting and input latency if baseline framerates aren’t high enough. If you have a GPU less than 8 GB of VRAM you aren’t running this game. The system requirements are a fat lie. You would need at least a RTX 4060 to run the game at 1080p native resolution anywhere from 30 to 60 fps. At 3440x1440p native resolution and generally medium settings you would require a 9800x3d cpu and 7900 xtx gpu and only get 60 fps on the heaviest scenes and hitting 85 fps during lighter areas. We don’t know what Crapcom’s target hardware was because it obvious wasn’t a PS5 because that thing is the equivalent of a 3700x and rtx 2070.

The high resolution texture pack is a joke and largely untested. It requires 21 GB VRAM if you ran the game at 1440p. There are only 3 consumer GPUs that have the capacity for this: rx 7900 xtx, rtx 4090 and rtx 5090. Crapcom go ♥♥♥♥ yourself? These textures were apparently also not properly implemented into the initial shader compilation so you are greeted with a mass of shader-compilation stutter mid game after the initial install of these textures. Don’t use this if you dont meet the VRAM requirements because it will crash or cause constant game stuttering.

So, can you turn down settings to make the game run? Not really, the largest visual gains are from reducing the resolution, upscaling, shadows and lighting. You take a severe image quality degradation or lose of artistic visual intent if you go to the absolute low settings compared to medium. And maybe only get 10 to 15 fps from doing so. Unfortunately as a whole the game just doesn’t look good. It looks maybe 20% better than MH:World and the environment doesn’t really look all that much different as a whole, but the game just doesn’t run good at all and the expected performance scaling just doesn’t make any sense. The graphical fidelity does not justify the level of frame performance we are getting in this game.

Optimization was an after-thought and may not get fixed with Dragon’s dogma 2 as an example:
- Environment, monster, npc, and small animal polygon count is way too high which is a significant gpu hit
- the heavy use of real-time lighting tech is a heavy graphic hit
- broken implementation of screen-space loading and de-load of assets with frame rate lowering every time the camera is panned.
- environmental simulation effects like lightning storms, rain storms and wind simulations tank frames
- why are film grain, lens distortion on?
- colour correction is broken. Game appears very yellow and grey with black colours not looking black. Everything has a washed out appearance. I have an SDR calibrated display so something is clearly off.

The gameplay? It’s good and maybe even excellent. It builds on top MH:world with the learning from mechanics experimenting from MH: Rise. Maps are bigger, there are more monsters present on the map. You can seamlessly transition from a solo-hunt to a multiplayer hunt pretty seamlessly into co-op, but with some caveats. But wait, there are weapon skills that aren’t working properly like Rapid Morph (speeds up animation of a transforming weapon) and HBG apparently does too much damage to a certain monster finishing the hunt in 30 seconds. Game play was rushed, appears unfinished, monster fights are too short due too low hp. This leads us to a question alot of people have been asking, is the game too easy?

Its a 10-20 hour low rank story section and it might take another 20-40 hours to get the end game. And yes game is too easy for everything except the final two monsters that are introduced to you. Now, I have cumulatively 2000 hours across MH:world and MH:rise on dual blades, but i didn’t use that weapon this time. I used switch axe which i may have ~100 hours of use in Rise. Supposably people are saying you’ll have the most difficult time with this weapon due to its lack of defense mechanisms, but outside final HR monster i didn’t feel the need to upgrade armor which is the whole gameplay loop of the MH series. Hunts also very short for anything that isn’t end game; like 3 minutes if you are just hammering the monster.

Expect roughly a year of drip feed-content every 2 months before the real-game. Expansion dlc, is released. If and only if crapcoms technical artist and engineers aren’t neck deep in development hell for optimizing their game if they are even trying to fix anything. So far we can see a reduction in quantity as Rise’s first content drop was 5 monsters compared to 2 in wilds.

I was going to talk about how the UI and HUD is better then in MH:world and that it should have gone through a bit more refinement to make it more streamlined, but the game’s launch state outside of general weapon game play has been a disappointment.

Aside that it actually is kind of low quality even with the resolution quality raised up, comparative to games - not of the same series but of the open world genre - that had gotten a lot of polish and attention to minute details, especially but not limited to Ghost of Tsushima.

Holy cutscenes batman, atleast we can skip them this time but if you do you're probably throwing out a good 4 hours of the game out from a title that already has a disappointing total large monsters on launch, which is disappointingly small compared to both base-game world's 34 and rise's 35, where in both titles hunts lasted longer on average to further expand the expected playtime before heavy repeat grind content was expected.

I have some experience with the older games, only really having a decent chunk of investment in World, Generations Ultimate, and Rise. I can definitely say with confidence this is the least punishing monster hunter between those options. If you have played even a single MH title before this one, everything you'll encounter doesn't have a combo that punishes extremely sloppy gameplay with near instant death, a lot of monsters that follow the bell curve of gear progression probably won't even be able to cart you in under 4 hits, and most single monster hunts won't last you more than 12 minutes on the longer end once you get a feeling for how your weapon combos work.


That said the combat and flow of gameplay is probably the strongest it has ever been with this title from how smooth combos flow to how good every individual weapon type stands on their own two feet, which is why I can't help but be critical of how overly forgiving and short hunts at the top endgame feel.
An example is wounds: Wounds are a great fun mechanic that reward exploiting constant wailing on one specific part of a monster, but they happen both way too frequently and do way too much (They can stagger, outright stun, distract the monster, and cause them to animation cancel in favor of the melee weapons' wound exploiting moves).

Soundtrack is good but I feel like it's lacking for any monster that wasn't the end flagship monster. I wish I had more to say on this but nothing aside a few specific monster hunt tracks felt all that impacting or left a lasting impression.

There's a lot of passive world interactions between all of the endemic, large, and small monsters. No locations necessarily feel dead, but there's a lot of artificial moments that come from the fact the maps have time and seasonal sensitive spawns where it feels especially fake between certain large monster interactions. Not necessarily a negative for me, but it's something that I had noticed that's worth mentioning for a game that incentivizes open world exploration.


Tldr;
All in all I think the game is a solid 7/10 on a sale, but at 70 bucks for something that I'd say borders severely under-delivered in quality control I'm pushed harder to be critical and say 6/10.
I can't recommend it fully to even the more diehard fans until we see what comes out of title updates and the eventual expansion, because it's hard to say if the difficulty decline and lack of endgame content in the current state of the game is worth investing into and enjoying the new polished kits of each weapon type versus picking up another title outright if you haven't already.",Not Recommended,3060,57.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 3

maxen1416,https://steamcommunity.com/id/maxen1416/,"A Disappointing and Confusing Sequel

(No spoilers except a brief mention of the flagship monster)

Great gameplay and combat overall, although there are flaws in some weapons' balance but my impressions of it are generally positive so I won't talk about that aspect. Instead I'd like to briefly mention that the ecological simulation in the levels is even further improved upon from MHWorlds' giving a lot of life to the environments.

Yet oddly and confusingly the game is lacking in certain QoL features like UI navigation (among others) that were present in previous games since World.
Content felt lacking and repetitive (which I didn't really mind), a little too many monster fillers via variants, and 0 elder dragons, instead we're given ""Apex predators"" for each region.
This alone took the passion out of some of my friends after they hit the end of the current content, this is a stark contrast to base game World in our experiences.

When compared to MHWorld and Rise, Wilds has the best presentation for the main story aspect, but it's horrendously written.
Storywise, World's/Iceborne was great and well-paced even if it was relatively mundane, Rise/Sunbreak was fairly modest and simpler, but highly appreciable because they replicated much of the classic MH charm which was often endearing.
Wilds' simply has enhanced presentation but none of the above's executions.

This is the first MH game where I came out the main quest hating some of its characters, World's handler was kinda annoying but I never thought she was particularly bad as the only character that I could point out from World, but in Wilds you're going to know exactly why and who I'm referring to.
The flagship monster Arkveld, I found to be impressive (not as Nergigante mind you), but the terrible writing of its associated story character utterly deflated Arkveld's impact for me.

Handler Alma must be among the best handlers in the franchise, whereas she's not a passive quest giver, but instead has a clear presence by your side even during hunts, however that doesn't say much since she's like one of the few 'handlers' in the series so far, she's also written to be a rather ""safe"" character, that is to say that I didn't think that she had any particularly interesting dialogue or humor written for her overall and during exploration.
The remaining NPC cast on the other hand, not so much, they don't hold a candle to previous games' characters, I'm counting even sidequest NPCs here.

The D3I patterns are present, which could explain the terrible story writing, but relatively subtle and ignorable. However Gemma feels as if she was designed to be a diversion to that fact via her apparent outfit design, since she felt like a third wheel in the main story, often making her presence questionable throughout the story's events.

So far there are two characters that feel like they're there to pander to old-gen players, namely MH4U, because as of the current end point of the plot, they had such ill-written justifications for their presences alongside our Hunter in Wilds' story, unlike World's leadership characters and side-hunters, which I do have to note to be a milestone, since World's story isn't that elaborate to begin with. These supposedly loved returning characters, have come to Wilds leaving their original charm behind.

My general issue of Wilds' storywriting is that it's that I was expecting anything considering all the MH games so far, it's that the story beats are horrendously written from the get-go, so many aspects were ill-conceptualized that it has me baffled, they couldn't even replicate MH's tradition of writing cute, charming, funny, triumphant, or all of the above characters to fill the game with, even if the overarching plots were simple just to move the player along to fight new monsters.

Anyways story aside, my impressions is that it's a game with evidently high production value and budget, yet it has baffling flaws and shortcomings for a game of its caliber and anticipated quality, the issues it has implies some amount of brain drain at the developing studio(s), if not simply a rushed development, and it goes without saying that the technical issues are prevalent, causing the savvier PC gamers to resort to the modding community to fix their performance woes, and even re-add the missing QoL features that existed in the two previous games.

These shortcomings make it seem like the game still had at least two more seasons in the oven to go, yet they launched the base game in this questionable, lacking state.

Which is why I felt so disappointed and confused by the game!
MHWorld was such a great game and set new standards for new-gen Monster Hunter games, it felt feature-complete, content-filled, and further refined with Iceborne expansion, in contrast to Wilds which barely has much of World's impact, let alone the state of its completion as a product which continues to be baffling to me.

I'll be wary of pre-ordering Monster Hunter games from now on throughout the future, perhaps Capcom has gotten to the state of being too large for its own good, I'm also a Resident Evil fan since their first games, and we've already been burned by RE3's Remake, and RE2 Remake's almost-perfect state where it had to cut content for release instead of completing the missing story beats from original game(s).

One final note, once we've hit the current content ceiling as of pre-Update 1, my friends and I ended up going back to MHRise / Sunbreak to complete the remaining content we abandoned in mid 2022, which says something about the MHWilds, take that as you will.",Not Recommended,4693,173.7 hrs on record,Posted: March 5

ckcy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ckcy/,"The gameplay itself might be solid as it is afterall a monster hunter title. What could possibly go wrong? Unfortunately, it genuinely deserves every single negative review or even overwhelmingly negative reviews due to its atrocious optimization.

Comparing to the previous titles namely Rise which was made on the same engine, Wilds demands outrageously high PC requirements due to poor coding and optimization, while 7 years ago World had nearly indistinguishable graphics to Wilds nowadays but required significantly less powerful hardware, aka a PS4.

Don't get me wrong tho I am leaving this comment with a 7800xt that is listed as the recommended spec for ultra 2k quality on Capcom's offical MH Wilds site. So I am not experiencing stuttering or lag. Still no one should be convinced that such mid graphic is sucking up every high-end GPU and the mid-range cards from just a few years ago are not even allowed to play at 1080p.

More importantly as one of the few hammer mains, I have to leave a negative review to defend our dignity. This pathetic weapon has always been unpopular, ranking around 9th or 10th among all weapons, and being too weak to even warrant a nerf. Yet, Capcom decided to make it further weakened in Wilds. Useful and powerful moves from World and Rise are either nerfed into the ground or outright removed in Wilds, namely the super fun slope charge attack and jumping attack back in World. And what did we get in return? A single so-called “new” move, Mighty Charge, which is basically the max power charged attack from World but worse, because now it has a meaningless and ugly af precast delay to swing that stupid thing before actually landing the hit. Meanwhile, every other weapon is getting flashy new moves with cool animations and high damage. I’m honestly too heartbroken to even list all the nerfs Hammer has suffered.

900h in World for reference
If you want to read the good stuff of the game go right to the bottom otherwise if you are a fan of the franchise..prepare for tears.

What is bad about the game:
-I won't go all too deep into the performance, it's an impudence. The game runs like ♥♥♥♥ and looks like a great 2015 title at that. I hope they at least try to fix some ♥♥♥♥, but at the moment the Japanese are too afraid to hurt their honour and ATLEAST ADMIT THAT IT HAS PROBLEMS!
-Why are you buying MH Wilds? To play the story alone? Great, have fun :) Oh..you want to play with your friends? Well, then prepare for the joyride of ♥♥♥♥♥ I can provide for you!
MP problem 1: The whole lobby system is a ♥♥♥♥ show. You cannot play the story together only at the same time. The MH World implementation wasn't good already, but this is even worse. Again, everybody has to watch their cutscenes etc. then you can join and do the quest together. With the exception now being every 3. quest blocks you from assigning other quest, and you get hammered from quest to quest until the story is done, and you can finally be the hunter you want to be.
MP problem 2: When you beat the story and are in high rank the whole lobby situation unfolds. There are 4 types of lobbies with their own Pro/cons:
1.) Open lobby
-open lobby with random people
-hunt together make friends etc.
2.) Squad lobby
-form a squad join the squad lobby, chat together and the chat stays forever (jep that's it)
-join each other's quest like Link Party
3.) Link Party
-everybody is in their own world, and you get a quest invite if somebody opens a quest. You can then join the quest.
4.) environmental Link
-you can join your friends lobby and see each other (probably what you would want)
-you can hunt together in the area the link was started in
-you CANNOT open quests only hunt in the area. This means if you want to do a sub quest you will have to leave the link, start the quest and then your friend has to manually rejoin the quest. If you want to go back to free hunting establish link again and so forth. This is the worst implementation of MP I have seen.
-lets say you are hunting in the desert and you friends needs to kill a forest monster. You think in this ""open world"" game you can change the area your hunting in? Well no, you can't..again you will have to leave the link, travel to the desired map and establish the link with your friend. There is so seamless experience here. After 30 minutes we accepted the situation and just went with the normal Link Party and did normal sub quests only.

It is by far one of the most frustrating MP experiences I have ever had in any game. MH Rise did it so good! F*** how did you ♥♥♥♥ this up so bad Capcom???? This game sells and hypes you up for a seamless open world experience, but it is everything but that. And know that more and more people finish the main story these problems start to arise.

Which brings me to the next point:
The main story (no spoilers):
-All in all it's a great story, and you get to learn a lot about the history of MH lore. But really it's rather a ~12-20h tutorial. The story is waaaay to easy even for everyday Jeff (surprise the next topic will be the difficulty :) ). You never hit a wall, you never get any difficulty beating something. Make 1 Armour set, upgrade your main weapon and your good until high rank. That is not MH for me. In MH World Nergi f*** my ass to hard i had to reconsider my whole set and i loved the feeling of victory after finally beating him! You never get that feeling in Wilds.
-The next problem with the story is the Child. You know every story with a child is going to be boring, annoying and every scene with Nata you just hope it's over soon. Whole story feels like a rubber cell, just be safe and don't hurt yourself hunter-san <3.
-Next topic with the story is the already above mentioned ""get slapped from quest to quest"". There are like no pauses or investigations of the world. The game sells you these great worlds and does not task you with exploring them? Also while you are walking with the other chars through the world in a quest most of the time you are locked in the walking animation. You want to loot the shiny ores while listening to the harm free story for pegi newborn? No! Bad player! You can't. You will have to get back there after the quest (if the game doesn't slap you into the next area and locks you until you progress..and progress..aaand..).
-Furthermore, there is almost no diversity in the monsters until you finish the story. You really feel the devs want to kick you into high rank and save some development costs. So they stripped the low rank to the utmost necessary.

Difficulty issues:
-As mentioned the story (or as I call it tutorial) is very easy. For an experienced hunter it's a cakewalk. For me the story experience was: 10 min of Cutscene -> run to monster for 2 min -> fight for 90 seconds -> run after the monster for 2 min -> kill it in 30 seconds or capture. Yep, I love my interactive movies.
-I am now 20h into high rank and the only difficulty I felt was when i had my low rank gear. After upgrading my armour to high rank, that was over. It's even worse if you play with friends. It takes longer to get into the quest than the actual hunt. Tempered monsters don't change ♥♥♥♥ as well.
-The wound system is super fun to use but the monster just seems to tumble from left to right. The more hunters, the worse it gets. You stun lock it to death if you time your wound triggers. The system needs a balance to keep the fun and difficulty on par.
-with the new move sets we have the upper hand. The monsters don't have a chance. Don't get me wrong I really love the new moves, but it feels the monsters missed the memo.
-YouTube ads are longer than the hunts. Just give me the skip button, Capcom ;).

The Cats/ Felines:
-They stripped the whole development and skill system of your buddy....no words. So boring. The cat can do everything now, you can't control them in any way. You can only do some side quests to upgrade their skills and craft them new gear.
-Not even gonna start with the cats now talking.

Farm for consumables:
-there is no farm. There is a similar system where the village people gather stuff which grows in the area. But it's just hideous and not fun to use. I want to put some monster poop on my fields to yield monstrous amounts of consumables, Capcom....or at least let me buy some stuff.

Camp system:
-Camps all in all are fun and great, but why does the Monster need to be able to destroy the camps? YES you can find ""safe"" spots but are they fun: no. Are the safe camps in convenient locations: no. Again, just a hideous feature. Also, no possibility to upgrade your camps maybe to camouflage them better? My whole chat log is filled with angry monsters hunting my camps. Who is the hunter again?

Now to the good parts:
Gameplay:
-The gameplay is a blast. The moves of hunter and monster are pure cinema und so much fun to use. Overall, a really great and fun experience (for 3-7 minutes).
-The flow of combat will have you want more. It is peak combat (difficulty aside).
-The different areas feel great and are fun to travel and fight in if you can run the game.
-The Armour sets look REALLY GREAT!!
-Weapon designs are also great, and they got rid of the copy and paste weapons of MH World
-I like the food and cooking system, gathering your food and cooking it. Great idea, love it!
-Great monster designs
-a lot of great quality of life features like being able to eat everywhere

The core gameplay is still solid.
A lot of cool new ways to enjoy the weapons.

The temporary(?) issues
Leaving terrible PC performances and optimization aside, the game feels in a very unfinished state with a non-repeatable final monster, low amount of monsters to hunt (and no elder dragons!) and various bugs regarding skills... but at least those issues will most likely be addressed over time with TU patches even though the launch roadmap looks very thin and stretched out already.

Other than that a lot of decisions around the game feel very backwards, starting with...

Frankly speaking, it's terrible, even more than World but given the franchise history, that's not the issue.
At least in previous titles, you were only suffering passively the story by going through dialogues quickly and looking up what were key quests in a guide maybe.
Here, in Wilds, you have to actively suffer through the story by going through various forced unskippable sequences, especially the infamous escort sequences where you are not allowed to stray far and suffer through bland NPC dialogues which wouldn't be too jarring if it weren't for their high numbers and how they break any pacing, on top of terrible writing.

On a similar note, several story points will actively lock you out from doing most of the content, including going out into the open field to hunt monsters and force you to progress the story further before you are allowed any degree of freedom and agency.
Similarly, some functionalities such as resting to change weather/daytime may also become momentarily unavailable until you progress the story again.
And the list goes on: even discounting the subpar story and characters writing, the game is actively hostile towards the player's experience, sometimes even disabling the skip functionality for some cutscenes, and the forced tutorial aspect really comes much stronger than before. Overall, it's a sum of grievances and annoyances that would be bearable on their own but when everything is put together, it leaves a very sour aftertaste.

Having played various portable MH games, I'm not actively missing some of the rigid elements of gameplay and welcome QoL with open arms.
That being said, while World felt that most changes were done for the player's experience benefit without drastically changing the overall difficulty, a lot of the changes in Wilds compound and contribute together towards creating the impression of a much easier game / lower stakes hunts, etc:
- Less stun due to damage being focused in a single hit instance and eliminating a lot of the combos, also a lot of long knockbacks prevent monsters from actively comboing greedy hunters
- The seikret pick-up while a helpful feature, will also go with the above and create a lot of opportunities for the hunter to get away unscathed to heal / sharpen without any danger
- More accurate hitboxes will make monsters whiff more often too
- The wound system creating a lot of downtime for monsters as well as iframes to the attacking player
- Offset attacks, while awesome and rewarding to trigger create even more monsters downtime and extremely large damage too
- etc...
None of those changes are bad by themselves (some like hitboxes, I wouldn't trade away) but everything combined allow much more leeway due to overall lower level of danger and eliminate the previous games focus on positioning and properly anticipating monsters moves. Since you will get away unpunished easily in most situations, there is less need to be methodical and little incentives for hunters to really get much better.
On the other hand, newer monsters also tend to get much faster attack patterns and comparatively highly damaging moves as well, as it trying to offset the hunter power creeping (despite some nerfed core skills) - and results may vary.

Some issues might get resolved by higher difficulty hunts and balance fine tuning with patches, some of the changes introduced would require controversial decisions if Capcom decides to revert them as it's not easy to take those away once implemented.

There are also other issues such as less inspired level-design in the maps and more minor nitpicks but those matter less in the grand order of things.

Everything combined leaves a very mixed taste: at core it's still Monster Hunter but a lot of the unique flavours are gone and while the game core still delivers a solid experience, the overall lowered difficulty and lack of monsters make it feel like the game runs out of contents too quickly compared to previous titles.
If Capcom is serious about it, the updates may turn this into a very positive recommendation but in the current launch state, I can hardly say it's deserving a thumbs up ; not a bad experience but clearly subpar compared to what the series has been able to deliver now.

Staying hopeful that future TU patches and the eventual G/Ultimate version will address the major issues and make it a fantastic experience.",Not Recommended,4167,53.8 hrs on record,Posted: March 12

Capcom is a master at making games with unparalleled fundamentals and doing everything in their power to make you wipe your balls with sandpaper for 40 hours to actually get to the good parts. tl;dr Game unfortunately still good but absolutely wait 2 years for when the Wilds G Ultimate Arcade Edition Electric Boogaloo expac pack is out and its 20 bucks. Maybe a little earlier if you're already a fan.

I'll echo the optimization issues, though my rig just brushes medium settings while having to look a little crispy which is more than I could ask for given how old it is, there's no reason it should look or run worse than World. I'm not looking forward to the TU dripfeed again either.
Gameplay when i'm allowed to play it past the five trillion on-rails segments is still pretty good though I'm not sure how much I care for the wound system or the whatever power clash mechanic made for people to make slowed down sakuga clips for tiktoks or whatever. Every newcomer except Doshaguma is fantastic so far and the returners I've seen got great glow-ups. I'm sure it'll even out once I get to high rank and they let me piss off from the main track and become an unchecked extinction event at my own pace but my god this has to be the worst LR experience since X and its three solid tiers of trashmons.

I've been playing MH for well over a decade now and every new game I always hope they can do something with their progression and more importantly their stories that makes them satisfying and worthwhile. I never really understood the prevalent desire to gun it to high rank/G rank immediately cause the climb up has always been part of the experience for me, and the MH setting is super cool and has so much potential for something less rote than ""go deal with the problem dragon"". And hey, you're only in low rank for like 10 out of the 4547809234 hours you'll sink in this game, why not make it something nice?
Unfortunately every time I wish for that the monkey paw curls. I liked World's story despite its shortcomings and mostly hated Rise/Sunbreak's. I love Wild's maps and monsters and I'm cautiously optimistic about what its putting on the table but ohhhhh my god it has me chewing drywall that it always seems to come at the expense of why the average player comes to MH while also never actually improving in quality given the absurd focus they keep giving it. It's still Just Okay like every other MH story is but my friend put it best where it just feels arrogant that they string you along all of low rank, skippable cutscenes but unskippable walk n talks, a lot of ""look at our pretty trees and our quirky characters"" when I see something I wanna gather real quick 3 feet from my tent but being railroaded back to the company pow-wow first. To use a dumb food analogy its like going to McDonalds and getting dragged through one of those overpriced themed restauraunts that offer ~an experience~ but you just get the same big mac in the end. Maybe I just need to run away and join the circus with how hard I get clowned every time hoping they'd have something more than Just Okay. I'm insane for thinking this I'm sure but ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ I would much rather have something worthy of the space its given than just axing it entirely, yanno? But it'd only be fair to make it FULLY skippable to balance it out. So if someone as deep in the koolaid it as me is chafing from these choices I can imagine its just downright unplayably intolerable for a sane player.

This could probably be more tolerable if it didn't also annihilate co-op, if the progression flags like World weren't it the absolutely horrendous menuing and friend code systems to get into a lobby let alone into the same quests as people on my friends lists is just inexcusable. I mostly hunt solo but MH is a co-op game to its roots, constantly putting that on some esotetic learning curve into a brick wall just isn't fair to the majority of the players. Given all the dumb cosmetic microtransactions that they'll sure have like World and Rise did, and weird boneless-MMO-live-service-isms, they seem to want the audience that just afks in towns playing dressup too.

chenys1994,https://steamcommunity.com/id/chenys1994/,"""Not Worth Buying Right Now!"" That's what I would like to say for now.

The game itself is good—gameplay-wise. It has nice cutscenes, great voice acting, beautiful views, immersive environments, and a decent storyline. However, it suffers from poor performance. Even the beta test had better performance than the full release.

Do I find this game fun to play? No. I found Monster Hunter: World to be far more rewarding when fully exploring it. Monster Hunter Wilds, on the other hand, doesn’t give the same level of reward or satisfaction for exploring every region. It feels lackluster compared to World.

Monster Hunter: World does an excellent job of introducing what the world of Monster Hunter is like—how it feels to hunt a monster and the satisfaction of finally taking one down. In Monster Hunter Wilds, however, I haven’t found those ""gems"" I was looking for. The hunting feels unsatisfying, with a lack of immersion caused by conflicting design choices. For example, every single tracking and transport aspect is automated by Seikret. The difficulty has also been toned down to the point where even players with ""skill issues"" (like myself) can easily beat the game.

This game seems to cater more to people who enjoyed Monster Hunter: Rise. (This is just my opinion after playing the game)

The story and cutscenes, for the first time, felt like the game nailed it. That said, there were still some plot points I completely disagreed with, but overall, they were fine. One part that felt unnatural to me was Alma’s reaction when exploring the forest for the first time. Shouldn’t she be surprised by the forest’s diversity? Everyone already knows forests are diverse, so it left me wondering: Why was this plot created, and who was it for?

The endgame bosses were less impactful and felt like a joke. In World, every single fight made me rethink which weapon to use—carefully considering which one fit each monster. Even for Xeno’jiiva, I switched weapons 2 to 4 times to find one that worked best and made the fight easier. This sense of challenge and strategy is completely missing in Wilds. The endgame feels unsatisfying.

""When the plot looks good but is ruined by its gameplay"" This is how I would describe this game. Nothing feels special or fun about it.

InterDimensional_Idiot,https://steamcommunity.com/id/InterDimensional_Idiot/,"This is a review that will cover all content at the time of writing 5/3/2025.

So Technically this game is still terrible, so if you're on a lower end system this is an immediate don't buy. I played on a 5090 and even then, I still had issues with frame rate due to my 5800x. I have had no other AAA game have such issues while also looking this mid.

Mechanically this game is also lacking. It's new mechanics either help to further trivialise key elements of the game or simply don't add anything of value. The open world which was one of the headlining features is essentially pointless. The areas are all connected though outside of the story you will never need to travel between them as monsters will always stay in their designated map.

The two-weapon system is also entirely pointless for most weapons. On all the melee weapons I tried the only thing of value I found was having a second version of your current weapon, so you don't accidentally swap to a weapon you don't want and so if you it'll be at full sharpness. There are some theoretical use cases. A sleep or poison weapon for example but that's all and even then, simply hitting the monster will likely outperform it in dps. You may think using a great sword with a sword and shield for wake-up moves could be an idea but given every monster (sans 1) is trappable you don't need to perform a wake up. For ranged weapons this does change a bit. You may want to swap from a pierce lbg to an elemental one or have a backup in-case you run out of ammo and restoking would be inconvenient, but this is still an extremely minor use case.

Finally, what in my opinion are the two worst additions, The seikret and focus mode. The seikret is much like the palamute from rise only it's spent time reading a map. This thing means you never have to traverse the world again. You can simply press a button and be taken to where you need to go. You can also have it come pick you up if you get knocked down moving you out of danger. This trivialises not only the traversal of the world but helps to further simplify combat. This also helps make the open world feel even more pointless.

Focus mode is for me the final nail in the coffin for this game mechanically and is what makes me feel that even with post launch content I still won't enjoy a lot of the melee weapons on offer. This mechanic entirely removes any need to learn lineups or be knowledgeable about positioning. Now you never have to worry about missing a great sword TCS because you can simply turn however far you want to make sure it hits. Gone are the days of near misses or those clutch hits that only just landed. You can now always be facing exactly where you want to and will always land your hits where you want.

As someone who came into this series with 5th gen I never really got when veterans of the franchise complained that the game was being made too casual, that the edges were being sanded off. Now I get it. There is no planning, preparation, or difficulty in this game. It might as well simply have a menu where you can select the monster you want to fight and place you in an arena with it. Inventory management, eating, combat, traversal, set customisation are all now trivial.

The new content in the form of zho shia and AT rey dau do help to alleviate some of this but a lot it is just because big health pool and big damage. They aren’t anything crazy to beat mechanically. In fact, AT rey dau felt rather easy especially in comparison to the other AT monsters that were on offer in world however it does at least give me faith that future content updates will make this game more interesting to play.

Spent well over three hours scouring the internet for fixes.

Both the Benchmark and the game would crash on Startup after reaching the menu screen.

Tried literally over a dozen fixes to get this piece of software to run.

Ryzen 9 7950x
RTX 4090
32GB 6000 mhz System RAM
Installed onto SSD


- Run as Administrator
- Run in compatibility mode, Windows 7 & 8.
- Allowed game to bypass Firewall on network.
- Allowed game to bypass Ransomware safety checks on network.
- Attempted to boot game without Frame Generation.
- Made sure Windows was up to date.
- Made sure Graphics drivers were up to date.
- Made sure Steam overlay was disabled, has caused games to not boot in past.
- Removed various .dll files from Monster Hunter Wilds .exe in hopes of bypassing Boot Menu Crash.
- Attempted multiple restarts on Windows to fix crashes.
- Attempted multiple restarts of Steam to fix crashes.
- Ensured game was utilizing my dedicated GPU.
- Attempted deletion of Crash report folder from within Monster Hunter Wilds .exe Crash folder to bypass menu crash.
- Attempted deletion of various steam root folders that could potentially cause conflict with Monster Hunter Wilds boot.
- Attempted to run game without Full Screen optimizations enabled.

Also heard yet again performance for this game has been terrible, and have seen the Youtube videos and screen shots to prove as such.

Both you and I know in time this game will be great, but I personally value my money more than this horrid experience thus far.

Game has already been refunded, (Thank you Steam <3) I would say as for most AAA games released now a days, it will be done in a couple years.

I did not listen to my gut feeling and bought on release day and paid the price.

I am aware out of the mass of people I may be the outlier but when you see forums with people scrambling to try and get a game to run on launch day it just ruins the magic of what could have been a stellar new experience.

Hold onto your money, stay out of the rat race, preserve your self respect as a consumer and go enjoy that backlog you know you have on Steam. ; )

P.S. Out of the all the games in my Steam Library this is the only one that has exhibited this issue.



UPDATE: After further testing I was able to find the issue, this issue has only been present with one other game in the past which was Black Ops 6.

I use MSI Afterburner to under volt my RTX 4090 to make it more efficient and run cooler while loosing 2 to 3% performance off the top end.

For whatever reason this game hates that I altered my GPU in this way. (Under volt and frequency changes.)

Why exactly, no idea, but after rolling back my GPU to factory settings no further issues are present and the game runs fine.

Still horrific performance though.

For anyone that may read this in the future if you are having hard crash problems at the main menu I hope this helps. ❤️

josopai,https://steamcommunity.com/id/josopai/,"Monster Hunter Wilds: A Masterclass in PowerPoint Gaming

I’ve always dreamed of experiencing Monster Hunter with the cutting-edge power of my RTX 5090, the very best consumer graphics accelerator on the planet. Little did I know, Capcom would take that dream and turn it into a PowerPoint presentation. Seriously, Monster Hunter Wilds doesn’t run – it crawls, trips, and occasionally just gives up entirely.

Imagine gearing up for an epic battle against a towering Arkveld, your armor gleaming, your weapon sharp… and then you watch the Arkveld move at a majestic 50 frames per second. I felt like I was watching a nature documentary from the early 2000s, buffering every few seconds because my dial-up couldn’t keep up.

At first, I thought my PC was haunted. Here I am, armed with the most powerful consumer hardware money can buy, and I’m getting flashbacks to playing games on a Windows 98 machine. I checked my settings, closed all background apps, sacrificed a small goat to the GPU gods – nothing helped. The framerate was so inconsistent I half expected the game to start showing me a slideshow of my vacation photos.

Even better, the game would occasionally stop to “think” about what it had just rendered, as if it were questioning its life choices. I’d press a button, wait three seconds, and then watch my character stumble forward like they were fighting through a sea of molasses. Immersive? Sure, if you’re trying to simulate the experience of moving through quicksand.

And yet, Capcom had the audacity to release this in its current state, seemingly unaware that “playable” and “powerpoint presentation” aren’t synonyms. It’s a bold strategy – releasing a game that no existing hardware can run smoothly. I suppose they’re just preparing us for the RTX 6090 launch, where maybe, just maybe, the game will hit triple-digit FPS without poopy frame Generation.

Until then, if you’re looking to play Monster Hunter Wilds, I’d suggest investing in a flipbook and some crayons – you’ll get a more consistent framerate that way. Bravo, Capcom. Bravo.

Seriously though, it is absurd that capcom released it in this state. Game looks like it's tiny graphical bump from world which came out 8 E I G H T(!) Years ago and I am getting 70 fps WITH DLSS activated. this is not okay, doesn't matter how you put it.

If your not addicted or some Monster Hunter junkie, don't buy this game in it's current state. Or ever? Since I don't think this will imporove, ever.

Or... if you need to je* off to gemma, which absolutely seems to be a thing in this community, go ahead buy it. I think the ""kool kids"" call that: gooner.

Horrible performance even on high end gpus, frequent texture pop-in issues, textures not loading properly(polygon hunter), stuttering occurring even when turning the camera while stationary.
The UI/UX is horrible as always, requiring multiple button presses for simple actions such as trying to join lobbies or drop items. There is an incredible amount of unnecessary menu navigation present.
The load times are noticeable but not egregious, however they should not be there in the first place for simple tasks such as setting filters or loading up a quest in the exact same area.
The multiplayer experience is quite baffling for a series that is known for their cooperative game play, if you wanted to play with friends then be prepared to jump through 3 different lobby systems. If you just wanted to join random players via the SOS mechanic, enjoy being told that the lobby is full, or you could not connect since the game loves to show you lobbies that do not exist.
It is also baffling that the environments had a lot of effort put into them and then proceed to railroad you for the story into a linear auto walking sim experience instead of letting you explore the new world they've created.
While it is release, the endgame of the game is quite barebones as you end up fighting one monster over and over.

It is very clear that Capcom rushed releasing the game before the end of March 2025 to meet their fiscal targets and they thought that they had consumer goodwill to burn.

Painfully bad, unskippable story that gets in the way of gameplay. Low rank is 50% cinematic walk and talk sections and high rank does not have a single proper challenge to overcome. Hunts last 5 minutes, maybe 10 for the hardest tempered monsters.
Focus mode makes aiming attacks trivial and positionning irrelevant. Just keep the camera pointed at the monster's nearest weak point.
Wounds give free stuns and massive damage, turning monsters into helpless punching bags.
If that is still too hard you can summon free AI helpers. You can also get the rarest monster materials from guaranteed quest rewards, i mean bro you don't even need to farm what little content there is. At this rate the next game is going to be an afk autobattler.

No felyne cook, no palico skill customization, no personal room for your hunter, no gathering hub, no final boss for high rank, the low rank final boss (which has no craftable gear for some reason) does not appear in high rank. No bazel/jho style invader.

Generations Ultimate on the Switch even looked a bit better. The graphics of Wilds are grainy and the lighting just looks bad.

Apart from framerate, the butchering of my favorite weapon the Insect Glaive is pretty bad. Fast and fluid gameplay was replaced with a slow charge weapon. To play the weapon optimally on controller, you need to have 3 right thumbs, an uncomfortable claw grip, or a controller with assignable back paddles.

I will update my review as they either fix or change the game to mitigate the main issues I have currently

Anti Cheat/DRM (Denuvo)

Could be the main cause of why the game is not working at a consistent frame rate.
Do not buy this game if you have a lower end PC if you care about the image quality of the game.

Lack of Monsters

The new monsters they bring into the game are a breath of fresh air.
Love some of the new ones to death but when you only have 29 monsters at launch when you have two whole game catalogs to fall back on is not a good thing. They should have much more to allow for players to have a multitude of monsters to fight in the end game but right now there are only 4 options if you want to grind for the best loot so you will get bored quickly.

Easy to complete / Substance of exploration removed

The addition of the bird mount is awesome! I am so happy that I do have a solution for travel across this great and expansive map but there is an extreme lack of agency on the player to do anything else but hunt the best top monster.

Examples :

- Currently no rainbow pigment so far, people are completing all of the side missions and there is no reward to do so. So it gives a lack of desire to do these unnecessary side missions.

- No reason to explore a new region like Worlds where you were rewarded for finding new locations excluding the base camps you can setup. Prior new zones would be uncovered and even locations would be hidden until you stumbled upon them. This makes it so players have no reason to jump off their mounts and look at the world outside of running from point A to B.

- No way to show off your cool collection of critters you caught, to even yourself like in Worlds.

There are many more but this is a main talking point of the issue is that the way the game should keep the player in the world instead of playing it like an idle game like I feel like I am playing now is not a progressive step it's a regressive solution. look at map while on bird, select mining outcrop and repeat, same thing for monsters on quests but you don't even have to look at the map it's already on. There is no hunt to find the monster nothing. What is the point of the world if you aren't going to make us engage with it out side of mats and monsters.


Over all I love this games bones and ideas, sure they messed up on some other changes for how you access mechanics but I can understand that they are trying new things to help the player that isn't really helping.
The hunts are fun excluding when my frame rate is in the dump or I see only messed up distorted models streaming across the screen.

They really needed to let this cook another year because after only 35 hours of play time I have beaten every monster and could do all the side quests but I don't see the point much for a big reward. I do like that I can grind for cool looking transmogs (armor overlays) but that can't be the only thing I am hunting for come on man.",Not Recommended,2495,40.5 hrs on record,Posted: March 4

FuckZhonya,https://steamcommunity.com/id/FuckZhonya/,"I preordered this game from a local gaming store at full price, which came with a steelbook.
I’ve already 100% completed the game in 86 hours, so here are my thoughts as a long-time Monster Hunter fan that plays on a low end rig and also fully completed World and even got my girlfriend to play MH: Stories.

Pros:
1. Crown Hunting is much faster – It only took me 67 hours, thanks to the binocular tool actually being useful now. You can spot crown-sized monsters with it, and investigations also improve the process. If someone finds a crown-sized monster and saves the investigation, that size remains the same for future fights. This makes crown hunting way easier, especially if you join the MH: Wilds Discord, where players share crowns. That community is hands-down the best I’ve been in—everyone was super helpful, and I never encountered a jerk while trading crowns.

2. Focus Mode is incredible – As a Sword & Shield and Lance main, Focus Mode feels like an aimbot, letting you adjust your attack direction mid-combo. You can even intentionally whiff the first hit of a TCS on a sleeping monster and land the final hit for massive damage.

3. Lance’s Stalwart Block makes you feel like a gigachad – you can move while tanking a monster’s flamethrower breath and smash their head while at it.

4. Seikret movement feels natural – You can control it like your character by turning off auto run in the Seikret settings.

I am a Solo player. I played mostly solo, except for crown farming. Having the monster focus solely on you makes their attacks more predictable, allowing for perfect blocks with Lance and SnS. In multiplayer, monster aggro shifts unpredictably, making things harder.



And, uh, it’s hot.

No need to return to base camp.

While they do make the game easier, they’re not a spammy “save me” button. If your Seikret doesn’t respond to your whistle, you can still get carted.

It’s replaced by the wound system, which allows for insane chain staggers if you don’t care about the damage boost and just want that satisfaction of focus strikes.

Attack Boost is now maxed at 5 instead of 7, but skills are weapon-exclusive. Not sure how I feel about it yet—it’s weird not being able to slot them on armor.

They can deploy flash bugs, shock traps, vigorwasps, revives, and plunderblade. They can even fly a mini helicopter, which is honestly adorable. You're no longer limited to just one gadget, and there's no need to manually select them before each hunt.

You can now pick up shock traps, pitfall traps, and bombs if they go unused. This is a great quality-of-life change, so you won’t have to return to camp if a monster limps away in the wrong direction.

A significant improvement over the classic tranq bomb, as they’re faster and more convenient to use.

The game is a stuttery mess when turning the camera. I had to install RE:Framework and upgrade Direct Storage from 1.1 to 1.2 just to make it playable. Even then, I couldn’t get stable 60 FPS. My CPU and GPU run at 70-80°C constantly, whereas Cyberpunk 2077 (max settings, no RT) barely hits 65-70°C. Specs: R5 5600, 3060 Ti, 16GB DDR4, 1TB NVMe, 100Hz monitor capped at 60Hz. I'm planning to give this PC to my dad or sister and upgrade to a new one so I can fully enjoy this game and everything it has to offer in the future.

Not sure if it’s just me, but reinstalling, verifying files, and disabling IPv6 didn’t fix it. It Made crown hunting unnecessarily frustrating.

Clicking each gatherer manually is tedious. This should be an obvious QoL feature.

The huge desert was perfect for his return.

I get that Alma studies them and releases them, but still…

Nowhere to rest with my Palico and chicken mount or display rare endemic life.

A pro and a con depending on what type of player are you.

Playing on both keyboard and mouse and controller, I ended up making just one radial wheel because navigating the menus is a pain.

Two layers of DRM that do nothing but make my PC work harder and hotter for no reason.

Seems to happen when switching from DLSS to FSR and vice versa mid-game. This one’s probably on me.

FSR + Framegen offers better FPS, but in my experience, Framegen makes text jittery and adds input lag. As someone who relies on perfect blocks, that’s a deal-breaker, so I had to use DLSS and play the game on low fps.

Artisan weapons are the best in the game right now, but they look terrible and I just hate the color green.

No Clutch Claw means no way to force monsters into rage mode.


This is the first time I’ve paid $70 for a game and played below 60 FPS. I kept ranting about its poor optimization, but at the end of the day, the good outweighs the bad—and that’s saying something. Still, Capcom needs to address the performance issues. I tried everything to appreciate the world they built, but it looks blurry and awful even when maxed out with RT on, upscaling disabled, and suffering at 23 FPS while doing so. I had to revert back to my original settings after I got my screenshots lmao.

Ranting aside, Wilds takes the best parts the older games, such as the 1st-4th gens, and World and Rise and refines them into what might be the best Monster Hunter game yet. The game is still in its early days, so I’m excited to see how updates improve it over time.

Buy the game if you have disposable income and are a hardcore Monster Hunter fan like me
Don't buy the game if you're stuck with a low-end PC like I am, you're better off spending that money on better-optimized games or upgrading your hardware.

Technical issues aside, a lot of decisions are baffeling at best. Getting rid of most of the preparation aspects but bringing back cold and hot drinks is such a weird in between.

The endgame grind is in the same state as Monster Hunter Rise was, when it released on the switch.

Just one monster you have to fight over and over again.

Even though the basis is there to make the endgame really amazing

Unfortunately, the Monster Hunter team has either decided, or been pressured, into making a game that most people will only be able to enjoy at its highest quality. A highest quality that only people willing to shill thousands for a current-gen PC will be able to enjoy.

Otherwise, the graphics are blocky, blurry, and slow - if you're one of the lucky few to have a system capable of it, they will even guide you into using a performance-hogging setting (Frame Generation) that is meant to do for the visuals what Monster Hunter World did without.

The controls are also too smooth, and attacks have about as much weight and hit-stop as Sunbreak. They also don't let you turn your attacks nearly as easily, nor roll out of them, like World did, they want you to use Focus mode for that.

Estrelina,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Estrelina/,"After playing for dozens of hours, I have more criticisms: first, the game has removed most of the details. Second, and most importantly, the equipment system is severely lacking—there are too few items, their appearances are just reskins, and the depth of equipment crafting is shallow and short-lived, making it extremely low in replayability. Capcom, this idiotic company, has been going downhill since Dragon’s Dogma 2. Prioritizing graphics at the expense of gameplay, they shamelessly cut essential game mechanics just to allocate more resources to visuals. It's truly lamentable and utterly ridiculous.

What does it mean to be a ""culmination""? It’s about launching a half-finished product, relying on long-term, drawn-out updates to patch up the missing content. This game manages to combine the flaws of Monster Hunter: World and Monster Hunter: Rise while shamelessly selling an incomplete product at a high price. Do any of you Japanese people even have a sense of shame?

Capcom is a dumbass, and the people who like dumbasses are the dumbest of the dumb.

I do not recommend purchasing this game for the following reasons: its optimization is absolutely terrible.

My system specs:

GPU: RTX 4080
CPU: 7800X3D
RAM: 64GB

At 4K max settings, I must enable frame generation, otherwise, the game is unplayable. With everything maxed out + frame generation + DLSS on high quality, I can maintain around 75-95 FPS, but as the playtime increases and when switching ecological zones, enabling Focus Mode or triggering cutscenes/dialogues causes massive stutters and frame drops. FPS will plummet from 95 to 18, then return to normal after a few seconds. I have no idea why this happens, but even my 4080 can’t handle it.

About the HD Texture Pack:
If you’re not using a 4090 or a GPU with at least 20GB of VRAM, do not enable it.

The difference is barely noticeable.
Turning it on causes frequent stuttering, massive FPS drops, and eventually leads to crashes.
Technical Issues & Optimization:
This game feels technically outdated and seems to have been developed by a team that lacks technical expertise. The textures and assets feel like they have no preloading and no proper shader precompilation, despite the game claiming that it’s compiling shaders. But is it really? Because everything reminds me of the old id Tech 5 engine, outdated and inefficient.

The texture streaming is absolutely terrible. If you turn around quickly, you can literally see blurry textures popping in and refreshing in real-time. Texture flickering and constant real-time loading issues suggest that one of the biggest performance problems comes from its texture refresh mechanism, which likely causes memory and VRAM overflow. This game feels like it has received zero proper optimization.

Frame generation itself causes issues after extended playtime. As mentioned earlier, its compatibility is poor, yet turning it off makes the game unplayable. The game’s optimization forces players into a no-win situation.

Considering the lackluster texture details, lighting, and ray-tracing reflections, the game's visual quality does not justify its performance demands. On top of that, RE Engine's color tone makes the game look even worse.

Gameplay & Experience Issues:
Monster Behavior:
Low HP monsters flee too often, making combat more about chasing than actual fighting.
Story & Pacing:
The story is incredibly dull, and most of the playtime is spent running around, watching cutscenes, and unskippable cinematics.
Ecology Issues:
Upper-tier monster ecology is nonexistent. Players barely see any upper-level ecological interactions, while lower-tier monsters are overrepresented.
Combat Problems:
Hitbox and collision detection issues make the combat experience frustrating and unsatisfying.
Final Verdict:
Monster Hunter Wilds is a poorly optimized, visually underwhelming, and disappointing entry in the series that fails to live up to the IP’s reputation.

Capcom is repeating the same mistakes Western AAA studios have made—putting too much emphasis on graphics and open-world size, while neglecting gameplay depth, story quality, and overall enjoyment.

To make things worse, Capcom's storytelling is as awful as ever. Almost none of their games have a well-written story, and while Capcom may be considered a decent developer among Japanese studios, on a global scale, they are a shameless company that doesn’t care about player experience and frequently milks their fanbase for money.

The only reason Capcom still survives today isn’t because their games are perfect, but because there are too many players accustomed to mediocrity, who have forgotten what good games are supposed to be like. To them, garbage is the best food in the world—because they’ve never tasted anything better.",Not Recommended,4213,69.6 hrs on record,Posted: March 1
7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198267480420/,"Can't recommend buying this game until some kind of optimization patch is released, if one ever is. A game with so-so graphical quality like this should not require a very high-end PC to run at 60fps. With a 3070ti and 8GB VRAM, I get about 45fps on average with noticeable drops in framerate when moving the camera or in populated areas - with medium-low settings. This in my opinion is just unacceptable and on its own enough for me to not recommend it unless you have a high-end PC.

The gameplay feels good while you're fighting, but monsters die way too fast and pose much less threat compared to previous games. Multiplayer systems are overcomplicated, and the actual content of the game is middling. The story missions are uninteresting, too easy, and force the first 12 hours or so into very linear progression that makes engaging with the game's good systems (like seamless environment exploration and quest making) a waste of time until you complete the story mode and reach high rank.

The lack of content is also disappointing and shows an over-reliance on post-launch updates to finish the game. Very small monster roster, NO elder dragons (end-game monsters), no gathering hub, etc. The story is at least complete this time, unlike Rise on release, but this is still not the state a long-awaited game that costs $70 should release in. The drip-feeding of content may make this game worth buying a year from now, but leaves it in a disappointing state now.

TLDR: The game has too many performance issues, questionable design choices, a lack of launch content compared to previous games, and overall is not worth the asking price.

But for everyone getting afflicted by the issue of random crashes it is virtually unplayable.
The issue arose just out of thin air all of a sudden, and has been present ever since.
There's an abundance of people who are experiencing the same or similar issues, and until there is a more reliable fix, preferably on the side of the actual game, the felt waste of time and money people have to bear with is astonishing.
The crashes are so frequent and omnipresent that it's fair to say most of people who experience them are unable to continue playing at all, if there isn't some random lucky solution they find on the web- some of which are really not things you should have to do with a high spec (or any) PC.

The following are a list of fixes that did not work to resolve crashes in this case:
1. Any changes to graphics settings
2. Verifying game files
3. Reinstalling the game
4. Changing compatibility mode to Win7
5. Updating drivers etc.
6. Running the .exe directly and/or running as administrator
7. Updating the version of direct storage used by the game
8. Increasing virtual memory
9. Fixing a typo in the games .ini file

Strandoo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Strandoo/,"This is a tough review to write as a long time monster hunter fan.

Let me start by saying i have always been more of an OG monster hunter team fan and though the world, im sure works very hard on games, has not been my cup of tea.

That said!

Despite the thousands of hours I have across the Mon Hunt games, I can't, in good conscious recommend this game.
Do I want to play with more people and more friends, Yes!
Does this game feel like a standard for what I expect out of such a long running series, NO.

Lets start with the good, because to me its a short list.

-Every game has some kind of new flavor to bring to combat and truly I do like the things done here. The additions for basic combat for each weapon are fun and exciting to discover and play with!
-The Handler, She is not the world handler so big win there. Low bar i know but hey.
-The Weapon design. I feel a bit torn on saying this is good, because while I do like the designs so far, it feels like the World team dropped the ball so hard in MHW on what Monster Hunter weapon design was that this is just back up to par. Not amazing but acceptable.
-Its a monster hunter game... I really did want to praise more but i sat here thinking for a while and it pains me to admit i don't have much more.

There are a lot about this game I find very lack luster but maybe not ""bad"". so i am only going to list off the really BAD things.

BAD
PERFORMANCE- Lets be real, if you are on the Wilds page you probably already know this is the biggest most egregious offender. A $70.00 game, with a LARGE beta testing under its belt, Knowing how large its audience is should NEVER have the kinds of performance Isssues this game has. From Frame rates in the low 20s on low settings for brand new computers to frequent crashing. This game feels like a really bad port. and for such a large and well loves series this is not acceptable.

As a side note, we all know Denuvo plays a good part in tanking the performance of a game so good job Capcom in making players that support you suffer. Morons.

Multiplayer- The core of Monster Hunter games has always been the Multiplayer. Go to the Guild Hall, or such for multiplayer fun. You can group up and just have a grand old time raising your rank and ALWAYS playing with your friends.
Speaking of playing with friends, It was as easy as, Join Friends Lobby or Join Friend.
The multiplayer aspect of this game is such a joke it makes me laugh. Whom ever designed, green lit and gave the go ahead on the way you play together has so painful obviously NEVER played a multiplayer game in their life.
From wanting to do Story missions with friends to experience it together and being stuck behind having to leave and rejoin after 15 min of walking and talking and waiting to view a forced on us cutscene and intro to either a monster or concept before a friend can re join and have to hunt and repeat for every player.
To
The dumbest, most over the top ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, Moronic joke of a party system I can honestly say i have every seen in not just Monster Hunter games, but any game I have EVER played. Like i cant stress enough what a Fuster Cluck this system is.
You have to Unlock Co-Op
Find the right Lobby for your needs,
Figure out how to add hunters as friends,
Maybe make a Guild,
Create a Link party,
Once you have done which ever specific order of operations you need to do to summon the Great Jaggris and make an Unholy deal with them to finally get in and see your friends, If you have quests relating to being out in the world and not just posting quests classic style you have another set of steps to figure out which player has to make an Environment Link for other to find and join.
All and all, for A game that should have some real simple and fun multiplayer i find myself getting mad at this system EVERY time I want to hunt with friends. Even now that I mostly understand the order i need to do things, its spectacularly unnecessary.

The Story and NPC's - Im am going to keep this short as to not spoil anything. I have never played Monster Hunter for the story. Lets be real, we here to hunt some monstas. That said, I VERY rarely just skipped the story or dialog.
Aside from 1 maybe 2 NPC's I don't give a Congalala's toot about a single NPC or story in this game, and that's sad to me.
Poorly written, Poorly forced in your face, The characters have no spunk and flare to make you like them like older games managed to do. Just no life in any one aside from a few feeling REALLY forced annoying.

The Style- To me, a monster hunter game has parts that make it run well. At its PEAK is monster design, From this stems weapon and armor design. Then atmosphere, NPCs you interact with, Level design and the unique style of the art team for this game.
I have never been a fan of the World Teams art style. I have always felt like the focus on showing off there environment over everything else. Mind you they do work a really amazing world. I just don't, personally like the art style and wish that a bit more love went into places that need it rather than making this MASSIVE unoptimized roaming world we traverse.
Though they make a nice world to play in, It feels a bit lifeless with out the staple Mon Hunt love added to it.

Conclusion -
I have more I could say but I didn't want to feel like I was beginning to rant. I love that we have a ""New"" monster hunter, and I am going to keep playing it.
That said, its also embarrassing to admit I supported the price, and state of this game.
My whole hearted recommendation to anyone not 100% a Monster Hunter fan that NEEDS their fix.
Wait.
Wait for more content, Wait for the game to go on sale, Wait for potential performance fixes, And just wait to show that for a $70 game in a series so beloved by so many, that its not OK to demand we pay more for you to give us such a unpolished Dung-bomb!

Roses are red, violets are blue,
From the depths of the Wilds, new monsters we pursue,
Through endless plains and through forests deep,
New lands await on distant shores

We chase the storm, we touch the sky.
The earth trembles the sky it roars,
With each new strike we carve our name,
Where beasts in shadows lie and sleep.

On wings of Seikret swift we ride,
With our Palico and blade side by side,
Through harsh desert and icy cold land,
With every step our legend grew,

Roses are red, violets are blue,
In the Wilds the monsters are fierce,
But with hearts of iron our spirits won't bend,
For the journey’s long but we’ll see it to the end.

reka_pr,https://steamcommunity.com/id/reka_pr/,"Disappointing Performance and Denuvo Ruins the Experience

I had high hopes for Monster Hunter Wild, but unfortunately, the game is plagued by serious performance issues and the dreaded Denuvo DRM.

First, the performance is unacceptable, even on high-end hardware. Frequent stuttering, frame drops, and inconsistent optimization make the experience frustrating. Whether in the open world or during intense battles, the game struggles to maintain stable FPS, making precise combat feel sluggish and unresponsive.

To make matters worse, Capcom has once again included Denuvo, which only adds to the game's problems. Not only does it negatively impact performance, but it also creates unnecessary restrictions for legitimate players. Crashes, long loading times, and constant background CPU usage make it clear that Denuvo is doing more harm than good.

Sephyrias,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Sephyrias/,"Monster Hunter Wilds is Monster Hunter World 2, except unfinished.

Pro:
- Combat is great. Weapon movesets are more fluent than ever before and the weak-point system has been reworked. The annoying ""Clutch Claw"" (of MH World) is gone and ""Spirit Birds"" (of MH Rise) are gone too.
- Armor and weapon designs are cool and you unlock the ""layered armor"" (=skins) feature for customization early on.
- Layered armor also no longer needs to be crafted separately.
- Low rank is more like that of MH World and not a pointless slog like in MH Rise.
- The graphics are a little better than in MH World.
- The 6 new environments are great and offer a decent amount of variety in scenery.
- The music is good, as usual for Monster Hunter.
- There is decent enemy variety, including a simple siege fight (Dahaad).
- The ""support hunters"" are similar to the ""follower"" NPCs of Monster Hunter Rise Sunbreak and continue to be a great addition to the series.
- Coop with random players uses the SOS-system of MH World, which is much better than the matchmaking system of Rise.
- Open world ""Expeditions"" have been improved. You can seamlessly hunt monsters that randomly appear on the map by creating quests for them on the fly. You can also save those quests to repeat them a limited number of times. It is overall like a mixture of the ""Guiding Lands"" and ""Investigations"" of MH World.

Neutral:
- Food functions different compared to other MH games. There is no kitchen anymore. Food buffs run on a 30-60 minute timer. You can eat mid-quest via the barbecue grill.
- You explore the maps of MH Wilds exactly like those of MH World. I miss the wirebug mobility of MH Rise.
- Your cat talks now, which I found strange, but you can turn the human voice off to get cat noises with subtitles instead.

Con:
- Wilds crashes a lot, especially in online multiplayer. It has been 7 days since release and the game already crashed on me over 20 times mid-quest. It is infuriating.
- Wilds is way too performance hungry. With a Ryzen 5600X + RX 6800 I should be well above the recommended requirements, but Wilds still struggles at 1080p low-to-medium settings. Meanwhile MH World runs completely smooth at high settings.
- Wilds is a very short game compared to MH World and MH Rise. There are only 29 large monsters in Wilds, including variants, and only around 100 fixed quests total, including story quests. You can beat all of that in about 35 ingame hours. Then all that's left is farming those same monsters a hundred times as tempered versions for deco jewels and special weapons - but they don't scale in difficulty like the ""Anomaly Investigations"" of Rise, they're just regular tempered monsters like those in World.
- Master Rank endgame is not included (it will probably be sold as DLC next year).
- There are too many walking simulator story scenes that you can't skip.
- Playing the story in coop is a chore, similar to MH World. MH Rise did this better.
- While the story is slightly more coherent than that of MH World, it still ends somewhat anticlimactic, which made me feel even more like Master Rank content is desperately missing.
- The game is too easy in coop, enemy HP doesn't scale up enough to match the damage output of 4 players, then even the hardest quests barely last 9 minutes.
- There is no garden to passively generate crafting materials in Low Rank. You only unlock ""Material Retrieval"" in High Rank by completing npc sidequest objectives. That makes the gameplay of Low Rank feel a bit limited for how long it takes to get out of Low Rank.
- You still only get a maximum of 3 character save files and editing a character's appearance costs DLC money.
- You can't meld rare monster materials in Wilds. Have fun farming the same monster 20 times for that 3% drop rate gem.
- No layered weapon customization, armor only. The best High Rank weapons in the game (""Artian"") all have the same design.
- Farming those ""Artian"" weapons is a massive chore too. Very clearly an attempt to keep players busy, to buy time for the content updates.
- I don't like the random ""offers you a meal"" food events. The buffs from those are huge, but you rarely get them. Also, you have to go through a loading screen to fast travel to a different region and then run to the npc there that offers the meal and pray that the fast travel didn't cause the invitation to expire. It is irritating and inconvenient.
- There is no gathering hub and no room for placing captured wildlife anymore. They will probaby get patched in at some point, but right now there is none.

Verdict:
If you are new to Monster Hunter, then there is no reason to play Monster Hunter Wilds instead of Monster Hunter World right now. The base game of MH World only costs 30€, while base game MH Wilds costs 70€ and has less content.
Come back to MH Wilds next year, once Capcom has added the rest of the game in content updates.

Even if you already completed both World and Rise, I would still be hesitant to recommend it right now.

yayababayaya,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yayababayaya/,"TLDR: Not recommended for now. Kind of a messy/unfinished launch, but a good game under the issues. Wait for title updates or G-rank expansion if on the fence.
Most of my time is achievement hunting. The game is fun and I've enjoyed my time with it, but it is shockingly low on high rank content and you'll be functionally ""done"" and will have seen it all in about 20-25 hours, unheard of for a MH game. If you're on the fence about purchasing, wait for now. The game is also EXTREMELY easy unless you're challenge running. Very little need to grind monsters for parts as the game drops buckets of them on you. Will update the review as the game progresses, first major update in early April.

My review doesn't count to the total on Steam due to purchasing a CD key.

Most of my hours in the game beyond the 25 hour mark are achievement hunting because I had nothing left to do. I had my gear set, I had my weapon and some others to play with, I'd beaten the hardest monsters the game had for me, all that was left was deco grind, artian grind, finding rare stuff, or completionist objectives. I only have crown hunting to do now.

The story is OK, better than I expected, but it feels as though the devs enjoyed RDR2 too much. Cutscenes are skippable, but forced slow walk and talk sequences are not. The pacing ranges from great to abysmal and attempting to co-op the story will be an exercise in frustration: Watch cutscene alone, leave quest, join friend, finish quest, back to solo cutscenes, repeat. You're let off the leash in High Rank and can play as expected.

Unfortunately monster health is VERY low. Playing solo it's fairly obvious, playing multiplayer it becomes glaringly obvious. Late game hunts against some of the hardest monsters can still result in a chain-stagger beatdown. Only two of the roster of actually felt dangerous or were able to cart me or other hunters online. At no point did I ever feel I would perform better by exploiting a monster's elemental weakness. At no point did I feel I really required armour skills. I beat low rank with the Leather/Chainmail/Hope pieces given to you for free, and I beat High Rank with a mix of the HR versions of the same sets. I only built a proper endgame armour set after having defeated the final monster in the game and ending the High Rank story.

Certain mechanics () are introduced then immediately forgotten about and feel completely disconnected from the game at large. The spoilered mechanic has no current bearing on endgame, and makes monsters have EVEN LESS health which makes them die comically quickly.

Menu/UI/UX design is certainly a choice. It ranges from very thorough to confusingly complicated and terrible at providing you proper information. For example, the Wishlist feature now puts pins on quests to let you know you can gain materials you want from it. Great QOL feature! On the flip side, there doesn't appear to be a way to check the description of currently active food skills. They appear on your status menu, but are not present in your equipment or skill info. Was it forgotten? Let's not forget the multiple multiplayer systems such as link parties, environment links, and so on.

Allegedly a significant number of skills are currently broken at launch. I've heard but not confirmed that skills such as Flayer, Rapid Morph, and more are currently either nonfunctional or not functioning as intended or as described. While the game itself plays nicely and is overall a smooth experience (unless you want to play low rank story with friends), the cracks begin to show the closer you look.

Wilds has a bad habit of giving you far, FAR too many rewards for quests. You are showered in drops constantly, and as a result I barely had to farm a monster for materials. The new wound system gives you a drop whenever a wound is destroyed, and even suboptimal play will be generating plenty of wounds. If that wasn't enough, a food skill can give you a SECOND drop on top of the first, so farming for materials is functionally a thing of the past unless you are truly unlucky.

Focus mode is cool, wounds are a much better implementation of the Clutch Claw Wound from Iceborne that don't break up combat flow, movesets feel good, and this is about as fluid as Monster Hunter has ever been. Monster health could use a 20-30% increase across the board to stop fights being regularly under 10 minutes for top tier endgame monsters, and under 5 minutes for normal high rank monsters.

There's a good game under here, and I certainly got my time and money's worth out of it, but it is far from perfect. Mired in confusing UI decisions, inconsistent pacing, terrible balancing in favour of the hunters causing even the strongest monsters to go down quick, very little need to farm, and a currently very lacklustre endgame that will have you cycling the same 2-3 monsters over and over while presenting very little challenge.

I'm personally hoping it gets better as time goes on, but launch has been both fantastic and disappointing in equal measure. If I could leave a ""mixed"" or ""Informative"" review I would. If your hardware isn't up to snuff or you're debating buying, waiting will serve you well as you'll (hopefully) end up with a fixed, content rich, and more polished product.",Not Recommended,4358,144.7 hrs on record,Posted: March 10

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198058863953/,"For context I have completed every quest of this game, slain every monster many times over, and exceeded HR 100. I am a veteran of 16 years in this franchise, and I consider it to be my favorite above all else.

This is why it PAINS me extremely to not be able to recommend this title.

Is it fun? Yes, when it works. That's a big WHEN because half of the friends I am playing this game with experience constant crashes, disconnections, and horrendously optimized graphical glitches. It's gotten to the point I can count more bugs and glitches in this game than I can monsters on the roster for it (which, by the way, is less than World released with).

If you can get the game to not have a fatal heart attack every 3 minutes while playing, it's alright. Player power feels at an all-time high, weapon mechanics are tailored to make everyone feel powerful AF, and the environment has plenty of things to interact with (though you will have zero reason to do this aside from things that damage/trap the monster). The maps look fine, the little details are plentiful, the animations are adorable/really well done (such as for Nu-Udra), the soundtrack is good, and there have been minor QoL changes to make the hunts a bit easier.

This is where the positives end.

All I will say about the optimization is that it is entirely inexcusable to release a game like this. If you experience a horrible black flickering screen glitch in-game, try turning Mesh Quality to Medium. It might fix it, or it might lessen it. Do better, Capcom; this is disgusting.

The multiplayer system is a tremendous headache. Long gone are the days of ""Join a hub. Put up a quest. Go on a quest."" Now we've got 5 sub-menus in the main menu to try and do gymnastics just to do 1 quest together before it crashes. Again, do better, Capcom. You had this right in the past; apparently, you must have laid off the guys that made those systems because these replacements are egregious.

As far as I've played, I can tell you that this is overall a downgrade from World despite what new systems we might have. The weapons and new damage mechanics feel good... but what you're using them against doesn't. If you've seen people complaining that the game is too easy, it isn't exactly just a barrage of hate for a newly released MH title this time. No, this game IS easy… but it isn't because the monsters are pushovers. Hell, I've been carted by a couple of monster combos that lead to my instant death. Difficulty in MH has always been a dance between pattern recognition and reaction time, variable based on which monster you're up against and which weapon you've decided to fight with. There is a pretty good field for skill to be displayed in MH, be it speedrunning or just flexing on the monster with parries/perfect guards, etc. While this game DOES give you new weapon mechanics to utilize against monsters, the dance of balance has been obliterated with the new Wound mechanic.

Wounds, inherently, aren't a bad idea. We had a similar situation in Iceborne with the clutch claw where we'd tenderize a part of the monster to do more damage. However, from battling all of the monsters, I've been able to deduce that it seems popping a wound with your focus mode will cause damage based on the of the monster. Not to mention, upon striking a wound to pop it, you will instantly stagger the monster regardless of its current animation and give it a flinch animation/make it fall over as you do. This leads to, quite frankly, embarrassing hunts where you will get a Wound Chain going and constantly stagger the monster 4+ times in a row while it cannot possibly react to the insane amount of damage and flinch it is being forced to take.

The hardest fight in this game as of the time of posting this review is . and quite frankly even THAT fight, should you get it, is actually not that difficult. With the previously mentioned wound abuse and just how many techniques you have for each weapon, such as parries, offsets, and dodges, you can make a mockery out of these supposed high-end enemies. This is where the fundamental design of Monster Hunter starts to break down.

In the past, if a monster was kicking your butt, there were steps to take.

Perhaps you should farm a different monster to get better gear to handle it.

Maybe you should go gathering to get stronger consumables to withstand it.

Possibly you could throw your head at that brick wall until you were able to handle it with your skill alone over many hours.

Now, in Wilds? Just kill 'em. You do so much damage now, and the monsters health depletes so fast that they had to limit you by putting offensive decorations ONLY on weapons and defensive skills on armor. This doesn't put a good enough limit on you, though, because as long as you utilize the wounds and new mechanics, you can easily make 1 set of LR armor and barely upgrade your weapon to go through the entirety of LR and HR until about HR 40~, and even then it wouldn't be a stretch to say you could get past THAT if you were patient.

Speaking of which, the story has never been good on MonHun, but I personally don't care. To me, it's just set dressing, letting me know what new area I'm going to shank monster meat in. When I care, it's when they force it down my throat with mandatory riding sections, snapping my neck in different directions as my ear is talked off. I come from a time where I walk into town, someone says Big Chungo the World Eater is world eating, I go on the quest and knock his head off, I come back, I get thanks, I move on. The pacing in this game is annoying to me because it made LR a hellish slog to drag my knees through (even IF it took less than 10 hours to beat it), I didn't care for the story characters going through their little moments (Nata can bite the backend of a Vespoid), and I was even more upset when I found out you are .

The final boss I'll also say wasn't the most tremendous battle I've seen; it was better than Xenojiva but not as good as Shara Ishvalda. In fact, there wasn't a single monster in this game that I thought was cool, aside from the new models of Xu and Udra, mostly because the roster is somehow recycled by HALF, and hardly anything they chose to put in will give you a challenge if you AREN'T wound abusing it.

Not to mention the lack of features from this Monster Hunter that even World had before it or others many years prior. It isn't exactly a secret that this game wasn't quite ready to come out of the oven, perhaps forced to be by Capcom.

Gathering Hub? Delayed.

Special Arena System with time challenges and preset gear? Gone.

Canteen? Gone.

Capture quests create arenas as in World? Gone.

Room to display endemic life captured? Gone.

RGB color scheme for completing all quests? Gone.

Special Difficult Quest tied to HR 100? Gone.

Choosing which equipment your cat uses? Gone.

Wider range of food skills? Gone.

Layered weapons? Gone.

There may be more things missing than I've listed, but that's enough for me to be saddened.

Seeing your favorite video game franchise fall victim to the modern ""live service game"" BS that everything else has been infected with is just dreadful.

If you're a veteran like me, you'll probably get to a high HR and wonder why it ended so fast/where the hell the end game went (they didn't add it). If you're new to the franchise, I strongly recommend you go take your friends to Iceborne instead and give that a good run. You'll get way more out of it for your money than this, though Wilds is definitely the lowest the bar has ever been for entry into this franchise if that means anything to you.

Will this game get better? Probably… But you and I both know it'll come with a $40 price tag minimum. Since this is the future of MH, I can only make one request.

I see people giving positive reviews for it just being Monster Hunter but in 2025 we need to ask better for games that cost a whole $70, when we have indie games that are less than half the price giving us compelling narrative, optimization, graphics, and creative gameplay, we SHOULD ask for more!

Instead of the devs investing more time in producing more content for the game, especially for the end game, a lot of the game's time is focused on the empty story, with several boring cutscenes, uninteresting characters, with slow dialogues that don't add anything relevant to the experience. This time and effort could be better spent on the game's strong point, which is the gameplay.

When you get to the end game, you notice an absurd lack of content and you quickly get tired of repeating the same bosses to farm weapon parts and decorations. In MH World, the end game was much more fun and challenging.

I regret having bought it when it first came out; the game is definitely not worth the full price, especially due to the already known optimization problems and lack of content. If CAPCOM releases new free content that adds to the end game and makes it less boring, I might change this review to a positive one. If the new content comes through paid DLC, this will be one of the worst purchases I've ever made on Steam.

Wilds is also at odds with its core design, being an open world game that -severely- railroads you in story segments. Hunts are few and far between during story segments, taking less than a third of my playtime after skipping half the cutscenes.

Outside of those issues, the monster variety is encouraging and each scenario feels unique so far. There's a new monster in the oilbasin that far exceeded my expectations from a mechanical perspective.

Focus attack as a gimmick is something I can only see lasting for this title. In my opinion, it is better than tenderizing/clutch claw, but it tends to get in the way of certain weapon types like IG.

The menu interface looks like it was compiled with AI, the game runs and looks awful and they're trying so hard to tell a serious story. Like, who plays Monster Hunter for the 10 minute slow-moving escort missions? This isn't Assassin's Creed.

And I'm sorry, but I just could not care less for the little boy and his family, I just wanna hunt big monsters and feel cool doing it but Capcom are making it all too much of a chore for me to care.

The game is way too streamlined; it's less about researching monsters and preparing for hunts, and more about just going from one waypoint to the next with seemingly no downtime. I feel like I'm just doing errand runs and whatever the guild ""authorises me to do"".
The new focus mechanic also needed more time in the oven because I feel like I'm being punished trying to experiment with the new controls and combos (which is way more fun) as opposed to just aiming and clicking the same spot for 30 seconds until a wound opens up and then I press one button and watch my character flail around and deal 10x more damage while I watch. Where's the fun in that?

The reason why World appealed to me so much was because I felt rewarded for the time I spent learning and eventually mastering a single weapon. There were times I realised I should've done a specific move because I would cover more distance and protect myself from getting hit, and then I would use that for future hunts - that was the feedback loop that kept me playing for over 500 hours.

You're better of waiting until loads of title updates have come and the game is in a more complete state.
What people got at release was a very gimped version of what the base game could and should have been.

The current ""endgame"" grind is sadly very limited for those who want to get the best gear for their hunter.
You'll be scouting for tempered Arkveld quests for both artian parts and decorations since he has the best chance of giving more drops.
The Apex monsters also have somewhat good drops but you don't find these investigations at the same rate you do Arkveld, and when you do the investigations give less rewards.

If you are going to play this game together with a friend from the beginning, be prepared for some classical MH online jank where you both have to go see the cutscene of the new monster, 1 person abandoning the quest to join the other ones quest.
It's still not a seamless experience, it's on par with MH World in how bad it is when it comes to going through the story with a friend.

Voltzahl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Voltzahl/,"I have a heavy heart about this entry in the Monster Hunter series. I love Monster Hunter, but I found myself feeling underwhelmed more than I did with Base World. While the foundation is fairly good, the combat, the monsters, and the animation being shining examples. Yet, there are a lot of aspects of Wilds that do not work.

For review sake I will be comparing only gen 5 (World/Rise) to Wilds, even though I am a old gen vet.

1. The Difficulty
A heated topic when it comes to MH but Hunters have so many new tools that make the game feel more like power fantasy over the survival hunting game it was in the past. Between flinching and stun locking monsters to death in less than 10 minutes. this is not engaging game play. For a game that used to be mainly focused on multiplayer, playing with multiple people will hurt your overall experience as the monster just dies too fast to appreciate or even learn the monster's animations. Difficulty is not evenly distributed throughout the campaign, there are no walls or challenging fights that force you to engage with many of the systems integral to the series such as armor crafting/upgrading and hunt prep. I was able to get through ALL of the Low and High rank in un-upgraded low rank gear I just haphazardly crafted along the way.

Compared to World, monsters flinching or disrupt hunters is drastically reduced, being stunned is extremely rare, blights from monsters are drastically reduced, tremors/wind pressure is near non-existent. I feel MH is becoming more allergic to sharpness, it is irrelevant as you'll never bounce. Healing and sharpening are free. Monsters in the story campaign DO less damage. A 3-star monster (which is the default used in story missions) has less HP and less damage than World story monsters (just look up the comparisons.) MH combat has always been about commitment and positioning, it is what set it apart from the faster combat of Soulsborne. While the combat IS fun, it's lacking in any sort of risk or long term engagement. I found myself watching whatever was on my second monitor more than the game, which wasn't the same case for World. Wilds is a step in the wrong direction, I dread the solution will be that monsters will become unbelievably fast and spam AoE attacks to combat Seikret use. Think IB Alatreon but on speed and more 1-shot moves.

Wounds and Focus Mode are too strong. Wounds are a main factor to why you can stun lock monsters to death, with 4 people you are constantly creating wounds, constantly having windows to attack while monsters stand still for a focus strike animation to finish. Focus mode erodes the importance of commitment in MH, you inherently increase damage output if you don't miss, Focus mode makes is really hard not to miss attacks. You don't need to learn attack patterns or safe openings when you can just auto aim. It's now more Devil May Cry action combat than the old turn based dance it used to be.

The healthbar is horrid. Again, you don't need to learn monster animations when the HP bar is screaming at you when a attack is incoming. LET ME TURN IT OFF, at least.

2. Seikret
It's everything I did not like about the Palimute in Rise and somehow even worse. The Seikret is too powerful. It acts like a infinite Wirefall (from Rise) with very forgiving I-frames. While pursuing you will get to a flee location faster than the monster, no chance to sleep. You can sharpen and heal for free on the Seikret. It completely changes the pacing of combat when it is a get a get out of jail free card, there is no pressure or risk when mounted. You spend >90% of the game on the Seikret. The auto-pathing is extremely aggressive, and you never are encouraged to learn the maps. You can gather while on the back of the Seikret so you never have to get off while gathering. The maps are designed with the Seikret in mind and it's really bad, sure they look pretty there are A LOT of confusing maze aspects, it makes the Ancient Forest blush.

3. Palico
Palico is not only strong, it's the jack of all tools. I had to bench my Palico the whole story because it's utility was too powerful. I didn't want to. You do little chores to upgrade the tools. The Felyne tribe quest lines in World where infinitely better and felt more rewarding and choosing the specialization for our Palico with it's tools was a more balanced system.

4.Story
The cut-scenes and monster introductions are awesome. The story and plot was not, you'd think with a bigger budget they'd actually put more effort into the writing. You have a few ""cool"" moments but it is mostly key jingling spectacle. Remember the cart escort mission in World? Prepare to experience it again and again and again. There are so many railroading moments of people just walking and talking it is immiserating. You're on rails constantly in Low Rank and it is not until High Rank you're set free.

5. UNFINISHED
The game is unfinished and there is no real excuse for it other than corpo greed. Rise had to deal with COVID, the bulk of Wilds development time did not. The fact we didn't have the final boss in endgame, the gathering hub, the canteen or player housing for endemic display till after launch is abysmal. Using Title Updates to patch in content that should have been in the game day one is unacceptable.

Graphically this game NEEDS optimization. I have a really beefy computer and even I have issues. Being forced to use Frame Gen as a bandage should not be acceptable. It's a beautiful game when in the season of Plenty, but you also spend all of Low Rank in the most dull weather conditions that make the game look muted and unappealing.

6.Misc
The Herding mechanic is half baked. Trailers hyped it up a lot but it comes into play 2-3 times and never touched upon again. Dung bombs are used maybe once or twice.

Investigation system is nice but not great. They want to encourage players to free hunt but hunting monsters individually with the occasional 2 monster hunts are EASY. Let up make investigations with 3+ monsters or to turn all the monster on the map into a hunt-a-thon with only 3 faints instead of every monster being a individual hunt with 3 faints each.

Rewards are TOO generous. RNG has always been a balancing act in MH, World was probably the best compromise of that system outside of Deco RNG. Gems and Plates are no longer a ""HECK YES"" moment when carving, you end up with way too much materials because of the wound system. Only needing to hunt a monster 2-3 times to get all the materials you need to craft armor. A lot of monsters I don't hunt because I have no need or motivation to anymore. World had a better ticket system that increased the chances of getting rare drops but with risks such as 1 faint, or a 15min time limit, instead of 100% guarantee. Also in World if you cut the tail you nearly always were given a tail on carve, in Wilds it appears that doesn't matter anymore and you don't have to cut or break parts to get specific materials. I've gotten tail parts from body carves, that just doesn't feel right.

Lack of optional content. Optional quests have been drastically reduced. Not only did they get rid of gathering and delivery optional quests, they also reduced the amount of hunting optional in general and NPC requests. You don't even have any capture quests as optional. You don't even learn about capturing until after the main story and you only have TWO capture missions making it seem more like a after thought. While some people might be okay with the free hunting direction of Wilds, I am not. I've already crafted all the armor in the game thanks to how easy getting materials are now. I want optional quests that give me more direction, more stuff like the fishing quest line that helps me upgrade systems, I want my rainbow pigment damn it. I want stuff to work up to, I want to feel like I accomplished something in my time played.

dettowo,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dettowo/,"An upgrade to World, a downgrade to the rest!

I don't really want to write a detailed review as it pains me to rate a game I really wanted like bad, so I'll just make some bullet points.
The game didn't run bad for me and I only had a few random graphic glitches and stutters, so I won't complain about the performance as a lot of other reviews already do that.
I'm only gonna compare this game to World, as it is the successor to that game AND the same dev team!



- The living ecosystem and choice to have multiple monsters roam around at the same time, even the same monster multiple times is amazing and makes the world feel much more alive. The best Monster Hunter experience, hands down.

- They took some risks with octopus monsters and making yet another chicken, but damn did Capcom cook this time around!

- Speaking of designs, the weapon and armor designs for not only the new monsters, but also returning monsters are stunning and a huge improvement from the boring designs in World.

- A few ambient sounds feel a little too loud, but that's something I can ignore because the world feels so alive with sounds.



- It's nice to be flexible and get more fast travel spots which also can be destroyed by roaming monsters, but I liked the system in World more.

- The Seikret. Oh boy do I dislike it... It sometimes just runs around as if it had a lobotomy, just to chase a monster in three different directions at the same time. Hopefully it will get patched and its pathfinding will be smoothed out a bit more.



- They could've learned from Rise or any other MonHun game before World with how multiplayer could and should be handled. But not only is it too complicated again, the game also didn't release with a multiplayer hub! Link Party and Envo Link sucks! Can't fast travel to another area when in Envo Link without it automatically disbanding. Envo Link is dependant on how far you progressed in the story and which monsters you're allowed to hunt AND connection issues seem to be rampant anyway, just like the classic World experience.

- Listen, before you complain about it being a minor issue: There IS MonHun language in the game that is being mumbled by NPCs in the background and even spoken by story NPCs when not in a cutscene or dialogue! So MonHun language got recorded for the game! And they even gave us MonHun language in World despite dialogue in story cutscenes, so that can't be an excuse!

- ... cooking cutscenes never were that bare bones in any game. Even World had 2 different cooking cutscenes on release! Boo!

- after the Dragon's Dogma 2 incident.

- While I like the story and the presentation, it's like having to stop every 5 minutes to do an on-rail section of following NPC X or Y, then go talk to NPC X or Y, have another cutscene or on-rail section and then you can actually fight a monster. It just makes the game feel so much more slower and tedious than it should and could potentially scare away new people from playing through the slog that is Low Rank.

- It never took me longer than 5-6 minutes to kill any monster in Low Rank and even in High Rank I get a max hunt time of 10 minutes tops. Most of the time in hunts is spent riding your Seikret anyway. Hope G rank amps up the difficulty, as a friend I played with easily endured all of Low Rank without upgrading his armor ONCE and only used the starting armor.

At the current state before the first Title Update, this is one of the overall worst Monster Hunter experiences for modern systems yet.

Haven't gotten to the nitty gritty of things, but this optimisation is extremely poor. Come on, many of us cannot afford the latest greatest gear to play newer titles- It shouldn't be heavily taxing on us, we are the majority. Video games can still be so well optimised if developers stopped going the highway, and instead take on a more slower route with many stops that could be greatly beneficial for the game, the players, and the growth of the company. I can't even play this on a stable 45+ fps, on a 2 year old laptop with a i7 12700H and RTX 3070 even with many of the glamour setting toned down...

I've been enjoying the game for hours every day the past week, and I'm in love with the world, the monsters and the characters. I thoroughly enjoyed the story, and am happy to say that there wasn't a single monster I didn't enjoy fighting! The world is beautiful and feels even more lived in than the maps of the previous games, and the changing weather mechanic further makes the world feel truly alive and dynamic.

I haven't gotten around to playing most weapons, mainly sticking to my go-to Switch Axe, and I absolutely love the way it feels. The combat feels as satisfying as it did in the previous games, and sometimes even more. The monsters are all teeming with personality and they each feel significantly different from the last, giving the feeling of an extremely diverse set of fights and experiences. I did find the majority of fights to be on the easier side however, only ever carting once in low rank, and twice in high rank by the time I'm writing this review. I have no doubt gotten better as a hunter since my previous games, however, and will reserve most of my judgement on difficulty until a few title updates have released.

The armour and weapons look amazing in this game, and especially the weapons look wonderful coming off of World. The designs all feel unique and inspired, although I do sadly think my main Switch Axe has some of the more boring designs. The change to having layered armour be unlocked instantly upon creating an armour piece in high rank is a godsend, and the grind for materials and decos has been reduced significantly. For me personally however, I think the grind may have been reduced a bit too much, as I feel like I barely have to grind out the monsters to get what I need to make armour and weapons, or get the decorations I want, but maybe I'm just really lucky.

And now after talking about everything I love about the game, it's time to talk about the bad and the ugly.

The game as it stands right now is broken. Multiple skills are broken, like flayer, or especially for me, crit element, part breaker and focus, which all don't work properly with the Switch Axe. As I've understood it, most of these skills worked entirely as intended before the full release of the game. I find it extremely strange that they would release a patch that would break as much, or potentially even more, than it fixes, leaving many players frustrated by the end-game as they can't make the builds they want, or leaving them confused as to why the build they spent hours making isn't working properly.

I've also experienced a good deal of other mechanics being broken, such as the villages inviting you for a feast. Every time I get invited to a feast, the respective villager I need to talk to disappears, and stays gone until their invitation no longer stands. The one time I was able to get to one of them before the extended invitation ran out, the game bugged out, nothing happened, and the invitation disappeared.

Now on to the most unforgivable aspect of the current state of the game, and the reason such an overall positive review is set to being negative. The performance.

I have an incredibly beefy rig. In fact, I upgraded it before the game came out to some of the best components on the market. My computer should have no problems running any games at the highest graphics settings, especially at 1440p, as I'm not a 4K gamer. The games native implementation of DLSS was entirely broken for me. Game was even blurrier than in the beta, framegen would randomly break and leave me with 30fps for some reason, and I had to actually turn the upscaling quality all the way down to performance to actually get a significant FPS boost.

I am, however, not an fps snob, and as long as I can hit a stable 60, I'm good. And my PC should be good enough to handle native 1440p DLAA with the highest settings at 60fps, and it is. But it's anything but stable. I'm not some insane tech guy atm, although I am currently studying it (so maybe soon) there seems to be something horribly wrong with the way the game loads in textures around the player. When I use the high-res texture pack the game's fps will halve almost every time I turn the camera 180 degrees, and it basically makes the game unplayable for me due to the constant intense stuttering and freezing. Turning the textures down to high from highest completely fixes this issue for me, but I firmly believe this shouldn't be an issue at all. It also doesn't help that the high setting is such an obvious downgrade from highest. There are way more noticeably low res textures, especially on the player armour and weapons, something that I feel shouldn't even be that low res on low settings due to how close they are to the camera a lot of the time. But these are only my issues.

I know of multiple people who have incredible trouble playing the game. Either the game barely runs at 60 fps at the lowest settings, or framegen is mandatory for them to get acceptable frames. One of my friends even gets regular crashes every 2-3 hours playing the game. These accounts plus all the accounts of bad performance I'm reading about every day make me really sad. During the rough beta I was truly willing to give Capcom the benefit of the doubt when it came to the performance, believing that they'd address most of the issues with the full release. And although the game runs mostly well for me, hearing about all these people who can't play the game because of the performance makes me feel like Capcom really didn't live up to their promises, and releasing the game in such a rough state is unforgivable.

I don't believe the devs working on the game are to blame. It's definitely someone higher up the chain rushing them and forcing them to use a game engine that isn't well optimised for a game of this calibre. This, however, doesn't mean I'm going to give the game any slack for how messy this release is. So until Capcom can roll out the patches that will address most of these issues, be it preformative or gameplay bugs, this review will remain negative until the issues have at the very least been fixed for me.

Capcom. I love your game, but this is not an acceptable state to release it in. Please address these issues as quickly as you can. And until then I cannot recommend this game to anyone with a computer considered any lower than mid to high mid-range.

The story, while better written than the previous entries, is constantly intrusive to the core gameplay of hunting monsters. Multiplayer is needlessly convoluted with multiple layers of connectivity leading to confusion, and it's virtually impossible to progress the story with other people.

If the game takes a $50 expansion and 3 years worth of updates to get interesting, and even then only is ""fun with friends"", then the game isn't good and you're getting ripped off.

Capcom has shown they really don't care for this game, not a single bug fix.

-The story is completely terrible, the worst story ever made.
-Performance is lacking, unless you have a pretty decent PC, you'll need to use frame gen, which is not well implemented.
-Low Rank is completely garbage, the Low Rank experience is just you being put on a leash and the game walks you through the (bad) story.

Honestly feeling a little swindled. I'll start with some positives first, because they are indeed there, but then it's the negatives. Bullet points for brevity and clarity.

The Good:
-Excellent new monster designs and combat, with top-notch animation work. All the new creatures feel fresh and alive. The equipment you craft from their parts is also lovingly designed.
-Environments are beautiful, albeit a bit small
-Mixing and matching armor styles between masculine and feminine without restriction is excellent
-Crossplay is always a plus
-Seikrets and their functionality are a lovely blend of the Tailraiders from World and Palamutes from Rise. Great addition
-Really liking how involved your Palico is with everything happening
-Environmental interaction during hunts (like pulling down boulders) is back
-Wound system and sneak attacks
-You don't have to wait on the countdown timer anymore when the quest is completed

The Bad:
-Figuring out how to play with your friends is an un-intuitive nightmare. It feels like jumping through hoops
-WAY TOO MUCH story; I feel like I'm playing Final Fantasy with this number of cutscenes. It really restricts exploration and the pacing is blazing fast. Who of us was playing World and said ""You know what this needs? More cutscenes."" Monster Hunter has always been about the hunt, the environment, and cooperation with other players. That is where it excels. This game feels like it wants to be a narrative adventure like Red Dead Redemption, but it falls so very flat. The hand-holding and railroading is exhausting. I want to explore, fight, collect, PLAY. Not this.
-Where's the farm, the pets (poor Poogie is still MIA), the room decoration, the hub town where everyone can chill and arm wrestle and hang out in each other's rooms?
-As you start progressing, some monsters will only have part of their set available for crafting (or even looking at) upon beating them the first time. Why??
-Lobby search is somehow worse than Rise. The sorting options are very bare.
-Wildlife collection returned but only in the form of getting some resource points and filling out a page in your book. I can't put this funky lil crab dude I caught in my tent.

Glitches and performance issues can and likely will be patched, but my problems with the game are core issues I doubt can be addressed. I have trucked through for 8 hours now, hoping and praying the game would open up and get better because I spent $70 on this. Honestly, I might just play through World again.
