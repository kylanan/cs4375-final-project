7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199229889942/,"Stardew Valley is a farming RPG that is fun in concept, but in my experience unfortunately not in actual gameplay.

This is one of the instances where I wish I could give a mixed review, however as my experience has been more negative than positive, this will have to do.

The game is fun for the first couple of hours, but as a game mainly consisting of routine, it gets rather repetitive as time goes on. You wake up, are able to do the same three things every single day before the day is over, and then it just starts all over again.

This leads me to the point of the time management and day cycles being just short of horrible. As the days are over too quickly to get much done, the days end up being foo fast paced while the overall progress is too slow paced. It takes too long to achieve anything at all, and it‚Äôs therefore too much of a grind for me.

Having to watch the stamina bar, health bar and the time at almost all times turns a game mainly advertised as cozy into quite the stressful experience.

Another issue I personally have within the game are the eye straining graphics & coloring. I‚Äôm aware that the game has its own stylistic elements, however I can‚Äôt play the game for more than roughly two hours at a time before the headache sets in.

A lot of these issues can be fixed through the use of mods, however I‚Äôm not a fan of having to use mods in order to deem a game as playable while ignoring the flawed aspects of the game.

I can sort of understand how Stardew Valley might be fun and fulfilling to some, especially if they have a lot of time on their hands, but for me, the game is just too stressful and unrewarding to actually have fun.

The NPCs and the concept of the dating sim were what had initially awakened my interest in the game, and as far as the NPCs‚Äô designs go, I can‚Äôt complain. However, all of them have fairly limited dialogue and interaction options. This gets noticeable after just a quite short time of playing and only adds onto the repetitive aspect of the game.

I might pick the game up again in the future in order to try to 100% complete a farm, but that would probably take a while as I would just lose motivation over and over again.

For the price, I feel it‚Äôs worth to give Stardew Valley a try and see whether the game is suitable for you or not, however in my case, this game ended up not being as fun as advertised.",Not Recommended,1935,22.3 hrs on record,Posted: March 29

whiplando,https://steamcommunity.com/id/whiplando/,"Listen, I tried for 50 hours. The relationship building is quite mechanical - you're essentially ""filling a meter"" by giving gifts and having brief conversations, rather than having dynamic or branching interactions.

Time Management is not something im good and and you get exhausted after a while. That makes sense but it makes everything difficult, especially if I can't find my way there or back.

Getting Lost. I get lost all the damn time. There's a whole lot of areas in Stardew and its hard to find them over and over. I like going out and finding my way through but it's annoying when you're looking for stuff all over the map.

. Let me explain. Stardew only really worked for me when I was play with others, and when I did, I could overlook the flaws cause I had another person working on tasks. But on my own, just feels draining.

, especially the long stretch? No bueno. I'm not a brainrot toddler who needs dopamine hits every 3 seconds (although I'm damn close lmao) but having all these very long goals that stretch over in-game years can kill the motivation to work on it. At least for me.

Should you play the game? Yea probably, it is a good farming sim and if you like those long term slow grind games, more power to you. But if you deal with any of these things, perhaps Stardew Valley is not in your best intrest.",Not Recommended,970,4.4 hrs on record,Posted: February 8

TheWildWolf,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheWildWolf/,"Well, I can't help it. But I must change the review to negative. Yes, I know it's a great game that everyone loves. A lot of content, and so on. And I respect ConcernedApe for his work and the fact that he still continues to support the game after all these years. But that's my personal opinion, after all, and I don't want to sugarcoat my personal experience with the game. It just doesn't feel right to me.

I don't like that there's so a lot of grind in this game. Did I say ‚Äúa lot?‚Äù How about a HUGE amount of it? And you don't have time for that for the most part. You have to finish the community center, water your plants, take care of your pets, fish, and be on time at your house after mines before something disastrous happens to your character. For a game that poses as a relaxing game, there's just too much chore. And you might say, ‚ÄúWell, it's not like you have to do it all, you know. It's just a sandbox game. Pick what you like and enjoy the ride.‚Äù But the problem is, if you're at all completive and maybe even an achievement hunter, this game can be a stressful time. And I'm not afraid to call this game a ‚Äúsecond job‚Äù.

Now that I've finished my rant about gameplay, I must mention my second problem with the game. It's the other townsfolk. After a certain amount of time, nothing happens to the characters at all. They just freeze and stop evolving. Even your husband/wife. Which in my opinion is a big crime for a game that is built around a village community.

Well. That's about it. I've finally actually said it.

P.S. And yes, it's a great game, as others have said. It just didn't click with me for some reason. Maybe when I play it with my family, I'll finally feel the coziness others are talking about. And maybe I'll even change my review back to positive.",Not Recommended,1455,241.3 hrs on record,"Posted: August 16, 2024"

peterhoivang,https://steamcommunity.com/id/peterhoivang/,"I bought it as a relaxing game, a way to destress. It¬¥s cute, have a great ambiance and lovely music.
I played it every day and enjoyed it, then something happened to me.

It was more than a relaxing game. It was becoming a stressful, tiresom game of tasks and relationship maintaining. New worlds/places and quests. It started to feel more and more of an adventure game and I got more and more stress. Not only do you have to reach and maintain a certain relationship level with the townspepeople but also your animals.

My daily tasks became more ande more, I started using gamepedia to know where to meet the different towns people just to maintain a relationship.

One day I just stopped playing the game, and haven¬¥t thought about it since. Only today when I needed some space on my pc and decided to look at when I stopped playing it. And it was in August last year.

Some say that you can just stop with the tasks, but the game does revolve around it.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198059487857/,"I really wanted to enjoy this game, and I do enjoy some similar games (Graveyard Keeper, for instance). However, this has some fatal flaws that just suck the fun right out of it. Most importantly, it's intensely boring.

1) The intro music and sound: It's not huge, but right off the bat this thing just BLASTS the music and sound effects at full volume and refuses to provide any real settings until you've completed the introduction (2 or 3 minutes straight). Muted my computer instead of listening to that nonsense. The menu is full volume every time you start the game. (You can mute the music side of it, to be clear).

2) The controls: Clunky doesn't even begin to describe this thing. Targeting your actions is incredibly imprecise, your movements are blocked by all sorts of things (small rocks, dandelions, random weeds), and everything is done via the same action key.

3) The energy bar: Good lord, why is this a thing? You use enormous amounts of energy just watering the garden or fishing. There's no argument of realism to be made, since you're fighting monsters in a cave and growing vegetables in a week. It's a cheesy mechanism to make the game take longer and force you to do fewer things in a given day.

4) The NPCs: There's no point in talking to any of them. I realize that you can build relationships with them and get additional interactions, but why would I want to when they only have one line that they repeat. The hobo who lives north of town is the only guy who I ran into who was interesting in the slightest.

The only part of the game I found even remotely entertaining was translating the message at the Community Center, and literally 3 minutes after I finished doing that the game just handed me the translation. That's right, I spent half an hour transcribing the fictional symbols on the tablet into Latin letters and figuring out the substitution cipher that was used rather than plant more parsnips, catch another fish, or fight flies in the mine for the 39th floor in a row. I wasn't able to translate the tombstone, but I didn't put much effort into that, so it may be possible.",Not Recommended,1745,12.5 hrs on record,Posted: January 5

serioustable,https://steamcommunity.com/id/serioustable/,"Stardew Valley is an incredible game and absolutely deserves every ounce of praise that it gets. It is a modern-day classic.

That said, I offer a warning for a certain type of person. Stardew Valley is intended to be slow-paced, cozy, and quiet. There aren‚Äôt a lot of optimization options for the gameplay, deeply engaging combat, or NPCs with a sort of incredible depth. It‚Äôs a game you‚Äôre wholly intended to detach from the real world and just soak in the cozy vibes presented. If, like me, you struggle with that, you‚Äôll find yourself frustrated as you grind through day after day for the next pay off some 4-12 in-game days away just to repeat the process again. If interacting with a small community and just tending to your farm doesn‚Äôt vibe well enough with you, it genuinely might be worth a second guess.

zenmachinegun,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zenmachinegun/,"It's unfortunate this game has been as successful as it has. Itself is a pale and malnourished imitation of its betters, now spawning its own inbred and equally deficient, if not worse, imitators. It's naive to assume a one man dev can replicate the quality and breadth of a studio made game like Story of Seasons or Rune Factory, but the developer squandered the agility and freedom he had when you step back and assess the game systems.

One of the biggest issues, one that I think exemplifies everything wrong with Stardew Valley, is that item quality exists in a kind of vacuum which creates a dominoes effect of wasting your time. There's no real reason to aim for top quality in anything. Quality is not additive. You will not be making high sell price cooked dishes out of top quality produce. The cooked dish will always be the same price regardless of what you use. Why bother keeping sheep at all when the quality of wool only determines a chance you might weave more than one piece of single-quality fabric? Why keep chickens, cows, etc, for similar reasons? The lack of any kind of consistency in this aspect has spawned several bandaids to adding back stripped quality, like the end game spice and aging casks, but it's just another waste of time. This is on top of the fact there are no maker queues, so if you're wondering why you have to baby your machines like you're trapped playing an abusive mobile game in these contemporary farming sims now, this is patient zero for that, apparently. Thanks, I guess.

While waking up for the umpteenth morning to dutifully check your crab pots for no real reason, you will find yourself in a village that is one heart event away from experiencing its own fentanyl crisis. Everyone is an alcoholic or alcoholic adjacent, orphaned or widowed, impoverished and struggling, abused, traumatized, suicidal, or just plain mentally ill. There's this immense tonal chasm between the writing, rural folk trapped by a lack of opportunities and an abundance of neuroses, and the world itself, one filled with talking fish and magic and monsters, and never do the two ever meet. I joked while playing this that it's a secret ancap game because there's no reason to pick nature over jojamart. In fact, the game punishes characters for your supposedly good and holistic deeds. And for what? A nice little building that nobody ever goes into and nothing inside is usable? Ironically, or perhaps on purpose, in a game filled with alcoholics, one of the best ways to make money is wine. It's accidentally misanthropic if nothing else.

If you played Pioneers of Olive Town and want to understand how such a disastrous thing could be made, or if you've just replayed Trio of Towns or RF4 too many times at this point, Stardew Valley is an interesting specimen to study for a few dozen hours (with mods, ideally.) It's a slow motion car crash, the likes of which we are still feeling the damage from and likely will continue to do so for many years to come.

A Screenshot of Stardew Valley
By: dlupal

I know a little bit about Stardew, that‚Äôs not hard to do, seeing as it has the width of an ocean, and the depth of a spoon. I struggle to even call SV a game.

You see, to be a game, you must be able to lose, and you can‚Äôt lose SV. You can‚Äôt really win SV either, there‚Äôs no real end, just a thumbs up from ol‚Äô grandpa and Qi there. It‚Äôs more a kin to a slot machine, and your prize is more grinding, or maybe the living hat.

Here‚Äôs a list of things I don‚Äôt like about SV:
-There‚Äôs too many items, and too many qualities of those items. Does anyone care about gold broccoli, or iridium plums?
-The music is lame and there‚Äôs not enough of it. If you‚Äôre going to make me play 150 hours, I need more than the same 10 farm songs over and over.
-The animals are really ugly, the pigs look like scrotums. Overall, the game is pretty ugly.
-It‚Äôs too easy. You‚Äôre always getting kickbacks and items sent to me I never wanted or used. I was a multi millionaire by spring 2, I had every iridium tool but pan at spring 3, what is left for me then? Hours and hours and days and weeks of grinding just money and crafting recipes? Fun.
-There‚Äôs a place you can go to remove the memory of your spouse, you can then remarry them like nothing ever happened, your kids? Just gone. That‚Äôs kind of sick Eric.
-There‚Äôs this moron he lets you just buy perfection if you want, and thanks to this loser and the losers that use him, the perfection achievement is a 1.5% instead of what it should be. Why did you add this Eric? Did you figure there so much content that no one would want to suffer it all? I did though, I did, suffer Eric.
-The writing. It‚Äôs awful, and there‚Äôs not enough. If you want people to play this forever you need more than one and half years of dialog, over and over and over the NPCs say the same things. Every character in the game is unlikable, and even they don‚Äôt want to live in Stardew Valley. Why did you write it like this? I think you should‚Äôve spent more time learning to write and less time coding more types of mayonnaise.
-The perfection achievement is really ugly, a brown triangle in a purple box? Doesn‚Äôt look nice along with my other ones.

Here‚Äôs a list of things I do like about SV:
-The two songs in the volcano are pretty good.
-The keyboard and mouse controls are quite good, very nice when you need to make 20000 bottles of wine.
-There is an menu option to tell you if you‚Äôve crafted something, without this, I would‚Äôve quit. It would‚Äôve been too much for me.

Eric, stop making content for SV. Only 2.1% craft every item, only 2.7% help the raccoons, only 3.6% ship every damn item (oh God, the items), 3.7% kill all the monsters, 6.5% dig up all the crap. You see where I‚Äôm going with this? You‚Äôre making content that no one plays, and the content you make is weak and not fun. Even crafting 30 items is only 21% Eric!

There‚Äôs too much content! And it‚Äôs bad content! How are you going to grow as a game dev when you‚Äôve pigeonholed yourself into this mess? You wanted to make an RPG, it‚Äôs clear after playing SV. But now can you? Your millions of fans want ‚Äòthis‚Äô, there will be no growth right?

Too bad, I hope you‚Äôll see the light. But I‚Äôm never touching this again. Saw it all, and what I saw I didn‚Äôt like.

The game is charming but the fatigue mechanic is dreadful. You spend 75% of the game in the first 10 hours walking to and from your house instead of performing tasks. Most of the fun in these styles of games is knocking out many tasks at the beginning because there is so much to do and this game completely removes the novelty.

Artificially closing stores on certain days and for certain times of days, alongside not being able to ""meet"" people while they are working needs to addressed. Burning through days and days feels wasteful.

If you are okay with being forced to slow down the game and waste 50% of your time walking back and forth to your house, then you might enjoy this game.

odanrc,https://steamcommunity.com/id/odanrc/,"I can almost recommend this game, as it feels amazing for the first dozens of hours. It is clearly a product of love, but this led to overextending its stay through luck-based goals.

There is a huge variety of tasks, but many of them rely on an RNG grind, or just take way too many days to complete, so the days end up being quite repetitive.

The combat system is incredibly annoying: sure, you may have a hard time when you first encounter a certain monster type, but once you understand how to overcome it, it becomes a very frequent chore. There should be a way to not have to bother killing monsters once you reach a certain point (e.g., with a repel).

The minigames are boring, and the kart minigame is incredibly bad. I understand adding them to the game, but adding achievements/tasks related to them is, IMHO, a poor design decision - the demographics of a farming simulator and a shoot-em-up do not fully overlap.

Finally, it is supposed to be a chill game, but you have a fixed deadline to sleep. This is incredibly inconvenient, as you are always looking at the clock.

Suggestions:
- There should be a way to permanently disable the prompt to have a baby, as otherwise you may end up accidentally clicking yes.
- If the deadline to sleep must exist, then I think that there should be instead an alarm-clock system, along with the energy-recovery solution, as it would give a little bit more control to the players:
-- You must sleep at least X (e.g. 4h, as it is currently implemented) hours per night, but ideally you would sleep at least Y hours (e.g., 6h, as it is currently implemented);
-- You select every day how much time you want to sleep (i.e., you are not forced to wake at 6am);
-- If you sleep less than Y, you recover less energy.
-- You can only stay awake for at most 24h",Not Recommended,1483,175.3 hrs on record,Posted: April 19

I bought this game recommended from friends, and kept playing trying to enjoy it, but it just felt so dull. a lot of the characters are one-note, just sticking to their core personality trait and having barely anything beyond that. along with a repetitive game play loop, that refuses to deviate much.

the only time the game isn't so happy is when you actively try to be a jackass, like giving garbage to people almost every day, or dumpster diving in front of them. but even then, they just immediately forgive and forget. the only not-so-happy thing in the game is the ""big bad corporation"" that feels so poorly shoved in there, it doesn't do anything. and most of the time the game completely forgets it's there. almost as if the game is apologizing for having the slightest bit of emotion besides happy.

on top of that, the gameplay can be summed up as ""go get stuff -> sell stuff -> buy seeds -> wait way too long for said seeds to grow -> get crops -> sell crops -> buy/get upgrades to get more stuff -> rinse and repeat"" it gets dull really fast. there are side quests, but most of them are just ""get specific thing"". and if you're really lucky, you'll be able to do a festival. which just boil down to, do a limited time task, or watch a lame animation.

jane_dair,https://steamcommunity.com/id/jane_dair/,"I've enjoyed Stardew Valley as something that has potential to engage with, there are a variety of characters that I wanted to get to know and it‚Äôs cute even if I find its personality to be mostly flat. It‚Äôs opening monologue from your passing grandfather, and his get-out-of-corporate-jail-free-card, the rundown farm he gives you, is an invitation to vanish from the soul-sucking life under capitalism we are all desperately searching for. It pokes at the nerve of that fantasy in a gentle and hopeful way. That being said, from my admittedly short, under 20 hour playthrough, my conclusion is that this game is more of a career change than any sort of escape, and your ‚Äúidyllic small-business-owner life‚Äù does a lot of things with roughly the same level of mediocrity and lethargy as any busy-work office-job can offer.

This may feel like nitpicking but I'd like to start with the observation that the movement is very game-y. Robotically responsive, no kinetic energy. This is pretty indicative, I think, of most of my issues with the game, nothing really feels good to actually perform. It‚Äôs floaty, you don‚Äôt develop any sort of kinetic connection to the place or work while playing, (maybe except the fishing minigame) its tasks are time-consuming, menial, and everything needs to be pried out of its respective shell to be experienced. You hardly interact with anything and really anyone in Stardew Valley unless it's to click-extract some resource, and it doesn‚Äôt even feel good to do it.

Some villager encounters were pleasant enough but they usually began with me barging into their rooms. (Abigail, Elliot and Leah for example.) Abigail thought it weird for a moment that I just showed up unannounced into her private space the first time but because this was a friendship cutscene the game had already given me the consent needed to enter these people's rooms without any emotional consequence. A disconnected emotional experience, between what is supposed to be a developing relationship between yourself and an in-game neighbor, and the game needing to hit each plot-point in its episodic small-town tv-drama way. It's stilted and feels so unearned even if the moments‚Äô emotional peaks were low stakes and mostly just pleasant. The scenes themselves make sense emotionally but only if you ignore this kind of staging, and I just can‚Äôt get past that. This weird dissonance was felt throughout my whole experience, again, it just felt like I was being catered to. In a game about developing a farm by yourself, fighting monsters in a cave by yourself, gathering resources and redeveloping a town by yourself, the in-person cutscenes with townsfolk felt like some of the loneliest parts of the game.

The farm development portion of this game also felt lacking to me. Your main goal is inevitably towards automation since you do all the work alone. Which is an understandable conclusion, given the potential amount of work there will become as you expand your facilities and output. It just makes Stardew Valley into a game about always making a bigger number: more crops, more farm animals, more money, etc. Purely preference of course, but the more I play games, the less I‚Äôm compelled by that notion alone.

All that said, I enjoyed this game for a while, as something small to do everyday for about two weeks, give or take. I would get up in the morning, make a cup of coffee and play 3 in-game days before moving on with my own day. This is a game of rituals and incorporating Stardew Valley into one of my own was probably the most meaningful connection I made with the game. It was at times pleasant and it's not completely devoid of character. My time in Pelican Town lasted as long as it did at the urging of my friends and the small deliberate sessions of play not leaving the game totally mealy-in-my-mouth afterwards. Just long enough not to out-stay its welcome. Until it did. My playthrough is far from complete but this was still a 20-hour experience, and after that long, for its best moments to be turned into a morning routine/chore, is both very fitting for the kind of experience I feel it had fostered up until that point, and is the road sign that points me to the nearest exit out of town.",Not Recommended,3507,25.4 hrs on record,Posted: March 5

el3ctricpenguin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/el3ctricpenguin/,"I wanted to like Stardew Valley, but after nearly 30 hours of gameplay, I can't recommend this tedious time sink. What initially seemed charming quickly devolved into a mind-numbing routine of repetitive tasks.
Farming: Hope you enjoy watering the same crops day after day, season after season. The excitement of harvesting your first parsnip quickly fades when you realize you'll be doing this hundreds of times.
Mining: Prepare to spend hours mindlessly swinging your pickaxe at rocks, desperately hoping for rare minerals. The cave layouts are uninspired, and combat is clunky at best.
Fishing: An exercise in frustration. The minigame is more annoying than challenging, and you'll catch the same fish over and over.
Relationships: Building friendships involves giving the same gifts to the same NPCs day after day. The dialogue becomes stale quickly, making interactions feel hollow.
Time management: The days are too short, forcing you to rush through tasks. You'll often find yourself sprinting across town just to give someone a birthday gift before shops close.
Even upgrading tools and expanding your farm feels like a grind, requiring excessive resource gathering for minimal payoff.
If you enjoy mundane, repetitive tasks with little meaningful progression, Stardew Valley might be for you. Otherwise, save your time and money for a game that respects both.",Not Recommended,1162,29.6 hrs on record,"Posted: July 3, 2024"

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198004877053/,"The game seems like it can be fun for some, apparently for many people, but there are a few reasons I cannot recommend it. If those reasons are no problem for you, you'll likeley have a blast, but I could barely play more than 2 hours before litteraly rage quitting and uninstalling, which kinda defeats the whole purpose of a cozy game.

- Time constraints. I had to mod the game before even starting it for the first time, because days are stupidly short. 14 minutes for a whole day means you get nothing done. Get out of bed, do a little bit of work, and the day is done. If you have OCD and want to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• done, and properly so, like ""I'm gonna clean that patch of grass before my house"", you're gonna need several ingame days. If you try to go on, the game forces you to go to sleep.

I've done all nighters. I've never, ever passed out at 2 am. Actually, if I'm focused on something, I simply CANNOT sleep no matter how tired I am, so why is my character such a weakling ? This is a terrible mechanics. You can mod this, so you get more things done, but the drawback is that it prevents the game from normally advancing events.

- Energy. Simply put, you're incredibly weak. Work the garden for 2 ingame hours (so not even 2 real life minutes) and call it a day. You energy is spent. That too can be modded, but damn, why are you, again, so weak ?

- Game doesn't properly support non QWERTY keyboards. My native language uses adifferent layaout, and for some weird reasons, a few keys cannot be rebinded. Says ""key already in use"". Well remove that use then, genius ! If I'm trying to replace a keybind, just, you know, replace the keybind, maybe ? That can be circumvented by switching keyboard layouts to QWERTY in Windows, of course, but hey, one more hoop to jump through.

So, we have a supposedly cozy game, worse even, the template by which all cozy games have been measured for the past decade, and it creates a stressfull environment by making sure nothing can be achieved, either because you run out of stamina, out of time, or are fighting the game itself.

If you use QWERTY and are fine with getting things done in very, very short bursts, this game is probably amazing. If you like to take time to get ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• done, either mod heavily, or avoid alltogether.",Not Recommended,1858,2.6 hrs on record,Posted: April 19

the_holysword,https://steamcommunity.com/id/the_holysword/,"Stardew Valley is an anagram of WALD VERYSLEAT, an acronym for ""WALking behinD VERY SLow pEople when you're in A hurry simulaTor"" which perfectly describes this ADHD-driven mess of unfinished amalgamation of ideas.

You move to Pellican Town to work on a farm you inherited from your grandfather. You get to grow crops, tend to farm animals and commune with the townspeople. In the process, you will grow a relationship with NPCs, maybe marry, hone your skills in farming, foraging, fish, eh, fishing?... mining? Comb- wait, combat?

The game will throw everything at you at once: fishing, quests, upgrades, NPC relationships, birthdays, town events. You have limited energy to do daily farm chores and it is never enough. You won't have money to buy crop seeds AND energy items. You're stuck with watering plants ONE BY ONE everyday. Some upgrades are supposed to alleviate that, but they require resources and $ which you still don't have. Some mechanisms are simply missing (mass seeding) whereas others are so endgame (mass fertilizer) that you might as well call them missing.

You walk SLOW. Mining and chopping animations, eating, slide in/out, fade in/out transitions, even the ‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•‚ô• load game screen is SLOW-BY-DESIGN. WALD VERYSLEAT. It is INFURIATING. One in-game day is 14m20s IRL, a walk to the mines takes ~43sec. Forgot something? Lol. Anything that makes the game tolerable (larger bags, horse, quality tools and sprinklers) costs $, which requires many hours of watering plants and nothing else. In single player, the game pauses when you're looking your inventory, cutscenes, etc but not in multiplayer. With two players I had (in a way) twice the energy but half of the farm space, twice the cost for upgrading tools and about 30% less time per day.

Artstyle is usually good, but some sprites are obviously from a different project (e.g. Desert Festival). Some NPCs are good, others are cringy charicatures, stereotypes trying hard to feel real. High quality produce converts into regular quality goods (e.g. all grapes produces regular wine, all fish produces regular sashimi), as if the devs forgot about it. Most food is useless as ingredients are better (both price- and energy-wise) than cooking them. You can have children but they remain as toddlers forever. There aren't ""multiple playstyles"", everything converges to casks+kegs with ancient and/or starfruit.

I don't consider this to be even playable without mods. Achievements work but the hardest one is an unrelated shoot-them-up minigame which is just as enjoyable as rolling until you get 400 on 20d20. It works fine on Linux but I wish it didn't. I cannot overstate this: unless you enjoy WALD VERYSLEAT, this game is TERRIBLE.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198054083408/,"Just kinda meh. I don't regret picking it up, but it's just not that good. Doesn't do much to improve on the games it was inspired by, they just didn't exist on PC before this game reminded every-developer-forever that you can make money with 'New Guy/Gal in Town' games. With just a single dev, updates are few and far between. Will likely be outdone by other games, if it hasn't been already.

There aren't many ways to modify anything meaningful when starting a file. Selecting the type of farm you have throughout the game is the most meaningful option. You can 'force year one completion', but you need to make sure that you're checking the time-sensitive vendor every time it's available or you're just out of luck for that year.

Days go by too quickly. This is a much bigger problem in multiplayer due to time not stopping in menus or during cutscenes. Kinda ruins the whole 'laid-back' feel I would expect from a game like this. The core loop is very very basic, and nothing really changes even after unlocks. Grow things, sell them. Sometimes you age them for a period of time but really it's just all the same. No crossbreeding, no genetics, no hybrid plants, just plant a seed, water it, and wait. I can understand not wanting to make farming that deep, but I was expecting the depth to show up in cooking recipes or raising animals.

You can fish and raise animals, but again, a lot of the outputs are just things you throw in the box to sell.

Cooking is the biggest disappointment. I expected a lot more from a game like this, but there are really only a handful of useful recipes and everything else is just filler. Most of the best/useful recipes are locked behind leveling-up character relationships. This isn't really a problem... until you realize how bad the other recipes are.

Interactions with villagers are cute, but don't always have depth to them. In my experience it just boiled down to giving a liked item as often as possible to get a recipe as fast as possible. Characters are unique, have schedules ect, but there is no in-game way to track any of it. I don't really focus on this side of games like this, but the lack of QoL around the relationship part of the game is noticeable.

Shops are also not available on certain days, which is just obnoxious. Doubly so when you waste hours running into town only to realize it's a Friday and the blacksmith isn't there.

I'm not a fan of the events because they take up the whole day. You CAN skip them, but it's really not a good idea at least for the first time going through a year. More seem to get added with every major update. I found them to be necessary and didn't like that I couldn't do whatever I had planned to do that day, but I'm probably in the minority.

Some aspects are very RNG heavy in a way that doesn't respect your time. There are a few important rare drops (prismatic shards are the biggest offender) with very low drop rates. If there wasn't a duplication glitch in multiplayer to help mitigate the time-sinks, I probably would have stopped playing.

The combat sucks. Not the focus of the game, but it is important to progression. Everything is basically a sword with faster or slower swing speed. There are also very limited ranged options. There's a wizard in town... but you can't do magic. Need to keep that realism I guess. Turnips grow in four days though.

10 years from now when the dev gets around to improving and expanding on the gameplay I'll probably like it more. Mods probably make the game much more enjoyable, but they aren't through the workshop so I haven't bothered.

levitatingGT,https://steamcommunity.com/id/levitatingGT/,"I realise this isn't the game I was looking for. I somehow conceived that stardew was a game where you build your own town and maintain your own farm with its cute little animals. However, you do not build your own town in stardew, the only thing you actually do is get materials, use them to make your farm.

However, something I haven't put enough time into is the actual story of the game. Stardew Valley focuses clearly from my experience on building ONLY a farm and giving a rich, linear story.

If you are looking for a full sandbox-like set of abilities to use in this game as in creating a town or expanding your towns land, this is not the game for you (and sadly neither myself). - Instead, if that's what you are looking for, you might want to check out Core Keeper.

On the other hand, if you want to experience a predefined area of town with very interesting stories for multiple NPCs, this IS the game for you. I hope others can find more joy in the game than I have.


Sidenote - The developer/developers of Stardew, I would absolutely LOVE a sequel to Stardew Valley which aims to be more like Animal Crossing: New Horizons. Animal crossing used to have a predefined town in majority of their games, but with this one, we were able to really make it our own.

If a Stardew Valley sequel could be made to fully embrace the making of your own town, I don't think I'd be the only one at the edge of my seat.

I leave a thumbs down only to show my opinion, and I know others believe that this game deserves the world.

Belemonguin,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Belemonguin/,"Started this game only knowing that it's a lovely farming sim for relaxation and fun. Turns out it‚Äôs a very tiresome farming sim.

My first playthrough was in singleplayer. Most of the tasks take a ton of time to do, eat up all the energy and yield nearly no results. The game does a bad job at explaining how things work. Where do I get the materials? How do I replenish energy when I run out of it after watering crops if food is not the option? Where do I get a quartz refiner? Plus you need to do everything at once, as all the activities in the game give materials to boost each other. And, oh, don‚Äôt forget to spend a whole day running around the town looking for specific people because they have super important quests for you and get sad if you don‚Äôt talk to them.


The fact that sprinklers are expensive and water a very tiny area is probably the worst decision in farming sim I‚Äôve ever seen. It feels like you have to treat the game very seriously, have wiki open at all times, know every single way to optimise everything and every exploit to get things running unless you are fine with getting almost no progression, no quests done and your chickens are unhappy because, as it turned out after 25 hours of playing, they need to be manually fed if they can‚Äôt go outside.

Again, you can play with your friends. The progression gets faster, but if the friend that likes tending to crops is not playing, no one can play.

The farming and watering crops mechanics is unbelievably dull and repetitive, combined with the energy mechanics which requires you to eat rations every few seconds (it's very unfriendly to new players starting the game, extremely annoying and unenjoyable)

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199426747944/,"I used to adore this game and play it on a nearly daily basis until the game broke on me. When it worked it was absolutely lovely! The gameplay was and still is VERY fun and intuitive, the characters are endearing, and there is no bigger sense of pride than progressing day by day through adventuring and building up your little farm and genuinely building up a connection with not just the other characters but your farmer and their farm as well. This game used to be my go to way to unwind after a stressful day at work. But I can't do that anymore.

First of all, my oldest save file won't work at all, I'm permanently stuck on Year 4 because every time I finish the game, it always chucks me out RIGHT before it could save and resumes on the same day every time I open the file. I tried EVERYTHING that was suggested online such as the fridge hack. Still doesn't work.

Escape Key doesn't work. Tab + Shift doesn't work. I tested on my computer including on other games, they all work there but not on Stardew. I can't progress almost at all, because I can't access Crafting or Inventory. Once again, Escape Key doesn't work, at all. Mind you, this is on the UNMODDED default game, no mods involved at all because I never got to modding Stardew as of yet, I was learning how to do that before I lost interest.

I tried bringing all of these up with the Creator and appropriate individuals in the past as what was suggested by other players. Just to politely ask how to fix my game. No response. Which sucks because this game was a gift to me from a friend. According to him and all the others who played Stardew together with me, their games don't want to work either. They've been reporting the same issues. Honestly. I just recommend waiting for Moonlight Peaks instead. It's not worth it to invest more than a 200+ hours on a game that works perfectly fine as intended the one day, and then suddenly becomes borderline unplayable the next.

ghost-bird,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ghost-bird/,"I want to preface this with the fact I've never been a fan of the sim genre, so keep that in mind.

I actually find the farming gameplay fairly fun. But my overall experience has been meh. A lot of my issues come down to QOL, dialogue, and the general non-farming elements of this game.

It feels like it's trying to do too much and ultimately gives a ""jack of all trades, master of none"" experience. Every feature except for the standard farming feels mediocre.

Dialogue is painfully dull and only becomes kind of interesting when you become a LOT closer with the townsfolk. This is fine I suppose except you're also supposed to *marry* someone, effectively making sdv a dating sim as well. Except, because of this lack of personality from npcs, none of them really ""hook"" you or are likeable/interesting enough to keep you pursing them. When you first meet them they're all just kind of meandering around and kind of just say hi to you or are just plain rude. One of them is straight up misogynistic (like around the second and fourth time you talk to him) and the other straight up tells you you're ugly (like the second time you talk to her). Again, I don't mind if npcs dislike you. But why would I try to even befriend someone who tells me I'm ugly or is misogynistic?

And the male npcs have vastly different ways of speaking and beginning dialogue while the female ones really don't except for Haley and the older women. This immediately makes the male npcs more unique and fleshed out than the women ones.

Decay system sucks, which is where if you skip talking with a character for a day or two, their friendship decreases and you have to work to build it back up. There were days where I didn't feel like walking across the map and just wanted to farm in near my house, but no, I HAD to walk to talk to a character so I wouldn't lose progress. All this really turned me off the marriage system and I wouldn't have tried to do if a marriage partner didn't help you around your farm.

I get that all of this this is probably to emulate real life dating, which is a long process of searching and getting to know multiple people until you find ""the one,"" but in a video game with a lot of walking, npcs, and bedtimes, this doesn't translate well.

Other annoyances with the npc system is that apparently there are cutscenes you can trigger, but you have to be at specific places at specific times, but you're never told when or where and there are a few you can PERMAMENTLY miss. These cutscenes help flesh out the world and characters but you probably won't see them unless you have the wiki open 24/7. Also with most npcs when you give them gifts they literally just say the same thing, this isn't bad but for example if you give Sebastion the exact same thing and he loves it, he will always only say, ""I love this, how did you know?"" it just makes the dialogue feel that much cheaper/less immersive, and would have been nice if he said something like ""I love this, thanks for getting me this again."" This isn't hard to code at all and feels like an oversight.

When you enter a cutscene, which usually involves entering an area, your character moves around automatically. This is fine of course but when the cutscene ends you're transported immediately back to the entrance of the area, signifying that cutscenes are more like just separate videos that the player watches and not experiences that actually happen in the world/with the characters. Again, not a big deal, but it's multiple, small things like this that build up and break the immersion/vibes.

There's also a lot of cute and interesting things in buildings, but you can't interact or do anything with most of them, to the point I don't even understand why they're there. It'd be interesting if you could go into a store, go to a shelf, and actually buy stuff off of it but you can't.

You can't save without ending your day. It makes the game feel tedious and stressful in early/mid game where you have you really be efficient with your time and make the most out of your day. No clue why it was designed like this. This combined with the fact that most events are one-day only, basically makes the game feel like mini-fomo. This also relates to...

Places closing early REALLY annoyed me at the very beginning of the game, basically forcing me to manage my money and time extremely well just so I could buy the beginner materials. You also literally can't stay awake past 2 am, and this would be fine except I chose the wilderness farm, which spawns monsters at night around your base (except it's not that much), and bc of the 2 am thing I never got to fight that many monsters so I don't even understand the point of the wilderness farm. Monsters also apparently don't really give you any necessary upgrades/materials while mining/chopping/foraging, etc. do (or the monsters drop them but at EXTREMELY low rates). So you *have* to spend your time doing those things while combat is something you put on the backburner, or is tied to mining. And since the wilderness farm doesn't have a mine close by, this effectively makes it completely worthless.

You basically need to always have the wiki up while playing, especially to know where to find mats and npcs (they should make it where their location gets tagged on the map once you get enough hearts). You can download qol mods, but my belief is that you shouldn't HAVE to. While I like mods, you shouldn't HAVE to get them just to have basic things like ""where I can I find this material so I can progress? Where is this npc since I need to ""

There's rare fish you can NEVER catch again, so if you accidentally sell/trash them you're screwed. You also get a fairy later on, but its color is random and you can't change it. And

Combat: Not very deep but is fairly fun.

Music: Very bland.

I want to preface this by saying that when I heard people talk about SDV having a diversity problem, I thought they were overreacting. I don't really care if a dating sim just has white people. But when I actually started playing, I realized they were right. Aside from the people, the game's vibes, setting, and culture are just blindingly white; and there's a lot of subtle microaggressions. The white NPCS usually wouldn't be a problem but it's feels bad this time because they all already feel very samey. Only 2 main POC npcs and only one of them is dateable (and she's half-white). Later on there are a few other POC, but you can't date them and they fall into the ""strange exotic merchant"" trope. The desert trader says ""your coin has no value where I can from,"" really trying to highlight how they come from such an ""exotic+mysterious"" place (despite literally just being a North African person). There's also some drama with the local shopkeeper and the big Joja corp. Shopkeeper tells the corp guy that he doesn't want his ""products imported from who knows where."" Yeah, I don't want any products from those nasty other countries like slimy tofu or curry, just my homegrown american potatoes!!!

No nonbinary option.

None of this is really that bad, but it really bogs down the setting and almost makes it feel like racist small town full of crotchety old people. All this combined with the fact that many of the white npcs are initially rude to you, hit a little too close to home for me, a non-white person who grew up in a white suburban town and had to deal with always feeling like the outsider, hearing similar negative comments, and being told to get over it because they're still ""nice people.""

So yeah, small problems build up and the gameplay isn't fun enough to make me overlook them. Will probably only play with friends.",Not Recommended,6303,17.1 hrs on record,Posted: January 5

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198305857472/,"Let me first address some issues with this game, and then I'll share my overall thoughts on it.

First, the five legendary fish can only be caught ONCE per account, if it‚Äôs not of the highest quality or gets accidentally disposed of, there‚Äôs no way to obtain it again. I hope this can be changed to once a year instead of being permanently unavailable after being caught.
Second, the Fairy Box is locked to a single color per account. I wish it could be modified, like the Frog Egg, which allows color changes. My Fairy Box is black, and it looks like a giant fly‚Äîpersonally, I really dislike it, but there's no way to change it.
Third, the cave forces a choice between Fruit Bats and Mushrooms, and once selected, it cannot be changed. I hope we can have the freedom to switch between them later.

Finally, I truly love this game, and it's precisely because I cherish every part of it that I feel so strongly about features that are permanently lost or unchangeable. These aspects make me feel like my carefully cultivated game save is no longer perfect, which leaves me deeply conflicted. It‚Äôs not just a minor issue‚Äîit feels as though the time and effort I‚Äôve poured into the game have been wasted.

Stardew is a game that is simple on the surface, but the world Barone has created is open enough for players to develop their own lore, and has inspired, in me, fanfiction and mod ideas. The repetition of the early game: the watering, the fishing, even (to a point) the monster slaying, has a meditative calmness to it that allows me to unwind after a day at work.

I am not good at farming simulator games, so on the 1st day (Spring), I had no idea how the farm worked (there is no tutorial and my IQ is very low). I spent my time rummaging through the villagers' trash. Apparently, they didn't like me going through their junk.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198073773261/,"One of my favorites: Stardew Valley

How do I sum up one of my favorite games of all time? One of the first co-ops I played with my girlfriend (now wife), and one that gave us so many good memories that its theme played as our wedding song?

The story is simple: To get away from the hustle and bustle of life in the big city, you move to your late grandfather's farm in Pelican Town, Stardew Valley. However, after many years with no one there, the farm is in disrepair and it's your job to rebuild it into a homestead your old grandpa would be proud of.

At first glance, Stardew Valley looks like the quintessential farming sim, with the story and mechanics modeled after the legendary Harvest Moon. But it is so much more - aside from tending to crops and animals, you can forage, fish, mine, fight monsters, explore, and interact with the citizens of Pelican Town. Eventually, you can visit and explore several exotic locations outside Pelican Town, each with unique puzzles, secrets, and NPCs.

It's truly crazy just how much there is to do in this game, and the best part is, you can do any of these things in any order you want - or none at all. Ultimately, it's up to you to decide what you want to do and how you want the game to progress. The game manages to strike that perfect balance of giving you just enough structure so you're not running around like a headless chicken, but are also not being hand-held the entire time.

The presentation is, quite frankly, delightful. The pixel graphics, character portraits, and soundtrack all work together to build a supremely cozy and relaxing vibe. The writing is surprisingly deep for this type of game, touching on some pretty dark themes without coming off as tasteless.

Of course, not everything is perfect. The constant lack of energy in the early stages, before you have a few tool upgrades under your belt, can be pretty frustrating. The hard cap where your character passes out at 2AM feels like your mom calling you in because it's past your bedtime. And for veteran players like me, who are returning after a major update to check out all the new stuff, it can be a bit of a slog to go through the base game content again in a new playthrough.

But all of these are minor gripes, especially when you consider that almost everything was made by one person. What Eric Barone did here truly boggles the mind.

The real magic of Stardew Valley is that, at least for me, every time I start another playthrough, it feels like coming home. And I can think of no higher praise to give.",Recommended,2091,854.5 hrs on record,"Posted: August 13, 2024"

Honestly, its visual style was off-putting. For a long time, I couldn‚Äôt get past the mental barrier that pixel indie games could actually be beautiful. But slowly, my opinion started to change, and eventually, I gathered all my willpower and bought it.

At first glance, Stardew Valley may seem simple, with its pixel art and straightforward gameplay. A typical indie game that might not impress hardcore gamers. However, beneath this seemingly simple exterior lies a true example of how games should be made. An engaging story, captivating gameplay, and an incredible atmosphere. It feels cozy yet never boring, offering players the freedom to use their imagination in what seem like ordinary daily tasks - tasks that, most importantly, you actually want to do. Eric Barone showed what it means to be dedicated to your craft, which is why the game was warmly received and, even after more than seven years, continues to enjoy overwhelmingly positive feedback from the community.

This game deserves everyone‚Äôs attention. Stardew Valley is a wonderful game, and I believe it suits anyone, regardless of their preferred genre or gaming preferences. The only thing I‚Äôd love to see added to the game is a Ukrainian localization.

It was 2023 when I was introduced to this game by my ex girlfriend and we played together. She hosted the game. It was honestly one of the best gaming moments for me ever, and till now I still remember all sweet things in the past: Her, the game, and playing the game with her. We were all noobies and barely know how to progress or make money, and we kept getting hungry and exhausted ü§£. After letting our crops die in summer and dying in the cave multiple times ourselves ü§£, we slowly learned how to play, making just enough to get by, upgrade tools and the farmhouse. Then we divided the roles and tasks... me being Noel the miner/fisher who did the caving and Ginger Island and her being the cutie farmer girl that she was, raising animals, harvesting crops and socializing/helping the villagers with their requests. The game was so happy, funny and relaxing. It was progressing at a steady slow pace, but that only means more quality time for us two goofballs to spend together... All the precious memories which I will hold dear in my heart forever.
Sadly, all good things come to an end. Through time, we progressed and achieved almost everything in the game, Almost. It was only an ""Almost"". We broke up, fortunately on good terms. We still talk occasionally, maybe just wanting to check out on each other. The game remains incomplete, unfinished and so does our love story. Now, everytime I just want to be reminiscing, I will play Stardew for a while...
Sometimes it's just really hard to keep yourself together when the music of this game seems to just wanting to shatter you with nostalgia..., so I pour myself a bittersweet cup of coffee, gaze through my window and think about my once dearest, most beloved/cherished girl and the first farm which we built together alongside with the memories, both of which I used to hold close to my heart, now far gone, lying beyond the horizon...",Recommended,1612,116.6 hrs on record,Posted: April 8

Tamxiety,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Tamxiety/,"Stardew Valley is such a chill game where you can farm, make friends, and just soak in the good vibes. I love that it lets you take your time, whether you‚Äôre planting crops or going on little adventures in the caves. Watching my farm flourish and adding my personal touch is incredibly satisfying. The music sets a relaxing tone, and each season brings its own unique feel. It‚Äôs a blast to play solo or with friends, and whenever life gets a little overwhelming, Stardew Valley helps me find a level of calm that few other games can match.

Stardew Valley is a cozy farming sim in which the player manages their own farm while slowly uncovering secrets that surround the little town.

Story

The player inherited their grandfather‚Äôs old farm plot next to the lovely city called: Pelican Town. Considering that the players isn‚Äôt enjoying their office job anymore, they decide to begin their new life in Stardew Valley on the farm plot of their grandfather. The fields are overgrown and the player needs to put a lot of work into their newly acquired farm to make a living from farming. The player meets a lot of new people that live in Pelican Town and sooner or later discovers a few mysterious things while slowly getting to know some of the townsfolk better and better. Can you turn the old farm into a thriving and lucrative farm? Will you dive deeper into the dangerous mines? Will you end up marrying the person you‚Äôve been talking to for weeks? It‚Äôs up to you what you do in .




I bought back in 2016 when it was released and at first, I kind of didn't like it much - maybe ""liking"" is the wrong word; I guess I wasn't in the mood for a cozy game and thought about refunding it but I didn't. I pulled through and played it for good 60 hours before not playing it for a couple of years.

In 2023 I picked it up again and realized that there is new content and lots of quality-of-life improvements since I played it the last time. There are a total of 8 different farm maps that you can play on - each come with individual challenges, advantages and disadvantages. The Riverland Farm encourages fishing from the very beginning due to more limited space but different maps like the Meadowlands Farm encourages farming and comes with two chickens by default. There's much more and some features have been in for a while but I just discovered it when I started playing it again in 2023. I don‚Äôt want to spoiler some of the things since I want to keep my reviews spoiler free in general so go out there and explore the game yourself at your own pace.

The multiplayer works amazingly well and is fun if you want to play with your friends. There‚Äôs also a farm that focuses on the multiplayer aspect of the game.

You can add mods to to spice things up, if you get bored of the base game. Some mods only change the appearance of the game, some add a bunch of quality-of-life improvements and some just change up mechanics, make the game easier or harder - depending on what you want or need. Stardew Valley Expanded is a very popular mod that adds 50 more locations, 27 new NPCs and a bunch more - and this is just one of many mods that expand on the base game.

Setting up the mods is pretty simple but it might takes some time if it‚Äôs the first time you‚Äôre doing it. The official wiki has a tutorial on it which helps a lot in my opinion.










If you think about getting you should give it a try.
The base game is solid and you can have at least two different playthroughs depending on if you want to rebuild the community center or if you want to go the capitalism route with the JoJaMart. The base game offers more than enough for a price tag of 13,99‚Ç¨ - I personally didn't regret buying it.

Stardew Valley is the ultimate 'just one more day' game. One moment you're planting parsnips, and the next you're in the mines fighting off rock crabs and wondering how on earth you got sucked into a double life of agriculture and heroism.

It's like The Sims, Minecraft, and a small-town soap opera all got together, had a baby, and then raised it on a steady diet of turnips and adorable pixel art. There's something oddly thrilling about spending 8 hours of real time obsessively organizing my digital farm while my actual houseplant wilts in the background.

If you've ever wanted to live out your fantasy of revitalizing a town, taming chickens, and getting love letters from an artist who wears sunglasses indoors, then boy, do I have the game for you. Trust me, after playing, you'll start eyeing your backyard suspiciously, wondering if it's large enough for a barn and a few cows. (Spoiler: it's probably not.

There‚Äôs something magical about Stardew Valley.

I bought it thinking, ‚ÄúEh, I‚Äôll play for a weekend and move on.‚Äù
That was 7 years ago. I now have a farm more organized than my real life, a digital wife who loves me unconditionally, and a shed filled with 300 jars of ancient fruit wine. I don't know what day of the week it is in real life, but I can tell you exactly when the traveling cart shows up in the Valley.

This game isn‚Äôt just about farming. It‚Äôs about healing.

You start in the chaos of modern life, burned out and tired. Then you inherit your grandfather‚Äôs farm and escape to the gentle rhythms of nature. The music calms you. The villagers surprise you. The world breathes with life. And before you know it, you're fishing at 2AM, debating whether to plant cauliflower or parsnips next season, and attending the Flower Dance hoping someone‚Äîanyone‚Äîwill finally accept your invitation.

üåæ The pixel art is charming.
üéµ The soundtrack is soothing.
üíå The stories are deeper than you expect.
üé£ The content updates? FREE. And HUGE.
üõ†Ô∏è The modding community? God-tier.
üíñ ConcernedApe? A one-man miracle.

This isn‚Äôt just a game. It‚Äôs therapy. It‚Äôs a warm blanket. It‚Äôs home.

If you‚Äôre sad, anxious, tired, or just need a place to breathe‚ÄîStardew Valley will be here for you.
Rain or shine. Winter or Spring.

The Economic Case for Love: Comparing the Returns of Marrying Doctor Harvey to Growing One Single Blueberry Crop

Introduction

Dr. Harvey, one of the marriage candidates in Stardew Valley, provides certain benefits that can be quantified and compared to those of planting a single blueberry crop. This analysis seeks to determine the profitability of marrying Harvey by evaluating the conditions under which he cooks, the value of the items he produces, and the expected annual profit.


Harvey's cooking behavior is influenced by specific in-game conditions:

Triggered on sunny days during daylight hours when Harvey is indoors.
Triggered on rainy days during evening hours when Harvey is indoors.


On rainy days, Harvey remains indoors unless it coincides with the Desert Festival (Spring 15-17), when he is not indoors in the evening.
On sunny Saturdays during Spring, Summer, and Fall, Harvey is not indoors during the daytime.
On Mondays, Tuesdays, and Thursdays of each season, Harvey is indoors during the daytime.


Rain probability of 18.3% in Year 1, decreasing to 13.725% in Year 2 and beyond.
Rain probability increases from 12.6% on Summer 2 to 20.1% on Summer 27.
Rain probability remains at 13.725%.
No rain occurs.

*Each season in Stardew Valley consists of 28 days, with weather conditions persisting throughout the entire day. It does not rain on full-day festivals.


Under breakfast conditions, there is a 25% probability that Harvey will cook, producing an item valued at 350g.
Under dinner conditions, there is a 25% probability that Harvey will cook, with equal chances of producing one of five items valued at 300g, 150g, 150g, 120g, or 120g.


32.59g, slightly lower than the daily expected profit from a mature blueberry plant grown in the greenhouse or indoors (37.50g).
4,524.52g.
3,332.31g.

Given the cost of the Mermaid Pendant required for marriage (5,000g), the initial investment is likely to be recouped within approximately one and a half years. Furthermore, Harvey ranks as the most profitable cooking spouse among all potential marriage candidates in Stardew Valley.",Recommended,1821,514.8 hrs on record,"Posted: August 11, 2024"

Are you tired of the daily grind? Do you dream of escaping to a place where your biggest worry is whether your virtual chickens are happy? Look no further than Stardew Valley, the ultimate escape from adulthood's responsibilities!

Pros:

Farming Frenzy: Forget about spreadsheets and deadlines; here, you'll spend your days planting parsnips and coaxing cauliflower from the earth. It's oddly therapeutic and strangely addictive - who knew virtual farming could be this satisfying?

Community Quirks: The townsfolk are a delightful bunch, each with their own quirks and stories. From the enigmatic Sebastian to the perpetually cheerful Emily, you'll find yourself drawn into their lives faster than you can say ""Iridium sprinkler.""

Fishing Follies: Whether you're a seasoned angler or just someone who likes watching fish squirm, Stardew Valley's fishing minigame has something for everyone. Just try not to hook a soggy newspaper for the umpteenth time.

Cons:

Time Warp: Warning - playing Stardew Valley may cause severe time dilation. What feels like 10 minutes in-game is actually 3 hours in the real world. Goodbye, productivity!

Relationship Drama: Trying to woo your crush in the game can be as tricky as navigating a maze blindfolded. One wrong gift, and suddenly you're getting the cold shoulder from Haley for the rest of your pixelated life.

Pierre's Markup: Seriously, Pierre, why are your seeds so expensive? Do you sprinkle them with gold dust while we're not looking?

Overall, Stardew Valley is like a cozy blanket on a rainy day - comforting, charming, and slightly addictive. Whether you're a serious gamer or a casual dabbler, this game will have you saying, ""Just one more day... okay, maybe one more after that.""

There‚Äôs something incredibly soothing about spending time on my little farm, whether I‚Äôm planting crops, tending to animals, or fishing in the peaceful rivers of Pelican Town. The game‚Äôs pace is slow and relaxing, which makes it the perfect escape when I‚Äôm tired or need to take a breather from fast-paced, action-packed games.

The beauty of Stardew Valley is how it allows me to play at my own pace. There's no pressure, no rush, just me and my farm. The music is calming, the artwork is simple yet charming, and the characters are warm and engaging, which makes it feel like a cozy escape every time I play.

It's also the kind of game where I can just get lost for hours, getting into a rhythm of watering plants, making progress with friendships, and exploring the caves at my own leisure. Whether I'm tending to my crops or decorating my house, I always feel like I'm accomplishing something, even if it's just small, peaceful tasks.

If you're looking for a game to help you relax and reset after a long day or a series of more intense gaming sessions, Stardew Valley is a perfect choice. It‚Äôs my ultimate chill game, and I always return to it when I need that sense of calm. It‚Äôs a game that truly offers a little bit of everything, and for me, it never gets old. If it ever does can just get mods and change just about everything in the game for a fresh experience.",Recommended,1256,174.1 hrs on record,Posted: March 12
dmitry_komarov,https://steamcommunity.com/id/dmitry_komarov/,"Honestly, in my view, Stardew Valley is more for a niche audience, especially those who appreciate old-school charm. I played it just to tick it off my gaming experience list, and because of its fascinating development story, which was covered by Jason Schreier and which you might not know.

Eric Barone lived off his girlfriend‚Äôs income while they struggled to make ends meet, renting a modest house with friends, all while his family doubted the project‚Äôs success. Yet, through four years of determination, he taught himself everything from coding to art and music, creating what became an indie sensation and a modern tribute to Harvest Moon. His dedication resulted in a game that has since captivated players around the world.

After Stardew Valley gained popularity, Eric Barone, the game's creator, had the opportunity to meet Yasuhiro Wada, the original creator of the series. This meeting was significant, as Wada had been an inspiration for Barone during his development of . When they met, Wada expressed admiration for Barone's work and how he had successfully revitalized the farming sim genre. This encounter was a touching moment for Barone, as it felt like a full-circle experience‚Äîhis childhood inspiration acknowledging his hard work and success.

I like such kind of stories. Such cases are crucial for understanding gaming, the nuances of the industry, and the involvement of individual creators and their dedication. They highlight how personal sacrifices and passion for beloved games can drive innovation and inspire future generations of developers

As a mental result, is the only game where you can leave your soul-crushing corporate job to find inner peace by... growing parsnips. It‚Äôs part farming, part small-town gossip simulator, where your toughest decision is whether to plant cauliflower or finally talk to the brooding guy at the saloon.

I feel my time hasn‚Äôt come yet to fall in love with this game, and I believe, that time will come one day.

superange128,https://steamcommunity.com/id/superange128/,"As someone who‚Äôs generally not into farm-based games with dating sim elements, like Harvest Moon or even Animal Crossing, the fact that I like Stardew Valley so much was a huge surprise to me.

On the surface, it seems like an indie version of games like Harvest Moon, where you micromanage a farm, talk to villagers, pursue a love interest, and so on. I mostly got this game because people hyped it up, and I had some online friends playing it. For some reason, unlike many others I‚Äôve tried in this genre, this one just blew me away.

I think I can pin down a few reasons why I like this game more than other farming sims, especially as someone who loves single-player games with actual plot and goals.

The fact that the game gives you a clear goal right from the start‚Äîbuilding up your farm well enough to impress your dying Grandpa within two in-game years‚Äîis great motivation. I‚Äôm generally not into games that don‚Äôt have some kind of end goal beyond your personal ambitions. What‚Äôs nice is that you can ignore this goal and do whatever you want, but for people like me, having an actual single-player end goal adds a lot of motivation to keep playing.

This is an indie game made with a ton of love and care, and it shows in the surprising amount of detail. The way ConcernedApe crafted each character, with their own side quests, romantic dialogue, and daily schedules, is impressive. I actually found most of the romantic interests pretty interesting. The fact that whichever player character you choose is bisexual is a huge plus‚Äîit lets people roleplay their own interests without being limited by gender-based restrictions like in Harvest Moon.

One thing that really hit for me personally was the 2D Legend of Zelda-style dungeon mode. Farming slimes, leveling up combat abilities, and collecting resources in the mines were easily the most fun parts of the ‚Äúgrinding‚Äù in this game. It made the game stand out from the usual farm sims.

Even the core farming elements‚Äîlike chopping trees, fishing, planting crops, and taking care of your pet‚Äîwere addicting and fun.

What really pushed me to fully complete the main story, though, was the co-op feature. In most farming games with multiplayer, it‚Äôs usually just a casual ‚Äúvisit each other‚Äôs island‚Äù thing, like in Animal Crossing. But in Stardew Valley, you and another player can fully share a farm, split the chores, and work together to complete tasks. This made the goal of finishing everything by Year Two feel way less stressful and way more fun.

For example, I focused more on monster hunting, chopping wood, and fishing, while my friend preferred farming, planting, and interacting with villagers. We worked as a team to tackle all the necessary tasks and pursue our own love interests‚Äîmine was Abigail, by the way.

Overall, I can totally see why this is one of the most popular farming simulation games out there. It feels like a true modern refinement of Harvest Moon and Animal Crossing, with a ton of options for players. It balances giving a clear single-player goal for those who want structure while also catering to players who just want to do their own thing. The addition of Zelda-style dungeon crawling, co-op, and the freedom to be bisexual all come together to make this game an absolute gem.",Recommended,2724,96.1 hrs on record,Posted: January 21

Confessions of a Bearded Bear Chasing a Wine Witch (and Other Poor Life Choices)

Let‚Äôs set the scene: a burly, beard-swinging mountain of a man (me) abandons his corporate chains to‚Ä¶ stalk an artist who lives in the woods and eats tree bark. This is Stardew Valley, where logic goes to die, and I‚Äôm its willing victim.

Every morning, I wake up in Grandpa‚Äôs haunted shack (yes, he watches me sleep‚Äîjudgingly), chug black coffee like it‚Äôs a cry for help, and sprint into the forest like a man possessed. Why? Because Leah exists, and that‚Äôs reason enough. She‚Äôs out there, barefoot in the mud, talking to mushrooms like they‚Äôre old friends, and by Yoba, I need her to step on me. I‚Äôd trade every prismatic shard for one (1) more of her infamous ""salads"" (a single dandelion leaf on a plate).

Meanwhile, Pierre‚Äôs over there running a very suspicious ""general store."" Sir, why is your back room locked? Why do you sweat when I ask about your ""special stock""? I‚Äôve seen the way you caress those melons, Pierre. We all have.

The world blooms wilder with every mod. Pelican Town stretches beyond its borders, revealing hidden cults in the woods, a wizard‚Äôs ex-wife who may or may not be a time-traveling alpaca, and enough new villagers to make the saloon feel like a feverish indie film cast. I‚Äôve automated my farm into a utopian junimo sweatshop because manual labor is for people who haven‚Äôt discovered the magic of ""right-click to existential freedom.""

In the end, Stardew Valley isn‚Äôt a game‚Äîit‚Äôs a vibrant, mod-fueled hallucination where I, a bear-shaped simp, can ignore reality, woo a forest witch, and let Grandpa‚Äôs ghost silently judge my life choices from the afterlife.

The fishing and the combat are a little shallow, if I'm really reaching for negatives.",Recommended,395,214.5 hrs on record,"Posted: December 1, 2024"

He's right, though. He's always right about what games I'll like...

Stardew Valley is more than just a game; it‚Äôs a tranquil escape. Taking over my rundown farm, I quickly got hooked on planting crops, fishing, and exploring the mines. The freedom to play at my own pace was refreshing, whether I focused on farming or building relationships with the villagers. The pixel art and seasonal music created an atmosphere that felt nostalgic and relaxing. One highlight was connecting with the characters‚Äîforming friendships and even marrying felt surprisingly rewarding.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199177424799/,"""Stardew Valley"" is a captivating indie game that blends farming, exploration, and social interaction in a way that feels deeply immersive and rewarding. At its core, the game revolves around inheriting a dilapidated farm and transforming it into something prosperous while building relationships with the quirky townspeople. The appeal lies in its simplicity and freedom, allowing players to choose how they want to spend their time, whether it's farming, fishing, mining, or getting to know the various characters.

The farming mechanics are surprisingly deep, with each season offering different crops and challenges, making each year feel unique. Growing your farm from a small patch of land to a thriving operation is incredibly satisfying, and the game‚Äôs relaxed pace makes it a great way to unwind. However, it‚Äôs not just about growing crops. ""Stardew Valley"" also encourages you to explore, fish, and mine, each activity adding a different layer of excitement. The mines, for example, offer both treasure and danger, and the thrill of discovering valuable resources or battling monsters keeps the game fresh.

What truly sets the game apart, however, is its characters. Each NPC in Pelican Town feels like a real person, with their own backstory, likes, dislikes, and routines. Over time, as you interact with them, they open up, and forming friendships (or even romance) adds an emotional depth to the experience. The game‚Äôs emphasis on community and connection is what makes it so special‚Äîit‚Äôs not just about farming, but about being a part of something bigger.

The soundtrack, visuals, and overall atmosphere add to the charm of the game, creating a peaceful, cozy world where you can escape and immerse yourself in a simpler life. ""Stardew Valley"" doesn‚Äôt just offer entertainment; it provides a therapeutic experience that is hard to match, offering hours of content and a deep sense of satisfaction as you watch your farm‚Äîand relationships‚Äîgrow.",Recommended,1654,3.2 hrs on record,Posted: February 1

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199028544138/,"One of the best games at what it does. The game is amazing and feels very welcoming on a first time playthrough and is even more fun on subsequent playthroughs. This game can offer one of the most stressful experiences with several tabs open at once, or a relaxing laid back fun little farming game depending on how you play it with no pressure for either route and I find that really valuable in a game. No play style or approach feels forced, no matter what you do, you are bound to progress but it also doesn't just hand it to you. Every single character feels real and unique, and the story is implemented so well. You can completely ignore the story and still get everything out of the game. I mean it when I say absolutely nothing feels forced aside from some fishing quests though there are some fun ways to cheese these and they're nothing intense anyway. There really is not anything negative I can say about this game except for how addicted I get to this game. The game does slow down and you lose much to do after perfection however this takes 10s-100s of hours so I find it a little silly to count it as a con, you are getting far more than you paid for at $15.

There are not really any ways to 'fail' the game, and you can take as much time as you need to accomplish tasks without having to worry about missing content (apart from one event) or achieving perfection.

I do, however, think that it is not very beginner friendly, in that the game tells you very little. So much of my time was spent having to read the wiki right from the beginning (community centre route). I felt quite stressed at times, in that there is always an overwhelmingly large amount of tasks to do in such short days. Though this is most likely just due to my tendency to min-max each day, and again the game does not force you to accomplish anything at all. You can sleep through years of the game and still be completely fine.

Nevertheless, I've had an amazing time and have reached perfection in a 102 hour save (finding 50 Pepper Rex was a STRUGGLE). Looking forward to my next playthrough on a different farm layout :).",Recommended,803,135.4 hrs on record,Posted: January 4

You can spend your days farming, fishing by the river, befriending the charming townspeople, mining for rare gems, or simply wandering through the beautifully crafted pixel-art world. Every aspect of the game is designed to be soothing and rewarding, making it the ultimate stress reliever.

TheSinnedOne,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheSinnedOne/,"Stardew Valley, the farming sim you didn't know you needed. It is one of those games where you tell yourself, ""I'll just plant a few crops and go to bed,"" but five hours later, you're knee-deep in a conspiracy involving your good ol mayor with his purple shorts, a talking bear, hoarding gold bars like a dragon, and debating who to marry. It's not just a farming simulator; it's a life simulator‚Äîbecause who needs real-life responsibilities when you can grow virtual watermelons?

At first, the game lures you in with its pixelated charm and relaxing vibes. ""It‚Äôs so peaceful,"" you think as you plant your crops. Then, reality hits: you‚Äôre broke, Pierre is overcharging for seeds, and some drunk guy just called you a loser at the bar. Before long, you're grinding in the mines at 2 a.m., desperately trying to find iron so you can upgrade your watering can before summer. And don‚Äôt get me started on the fishing mini-game, which is less ‚Äúrelaxing pastime‚Äù and more ‚ÄúDark Souls with a rod.‚Äù

Relationships in Stardew are another level of emotional manipulation. You can spend months wooing a villager, gifting them precious amethysts and perfectly cooked meals, only for them to say, ""Thanks, but I don't really like this."" Excuse me, Haley, that diamond was worth more than your entire personality. But hey, it's all worth it when you finally get a reluctant ""I guess you're okay"" at two hearts. At least Abigail appreciates the amethyst, in her own way of course.

The Community Center is where things truly spiral. Instead of enjoying your idyllic farm life, you're now a slave to the Junimos, grinding to find one random crop you need or a duck feather to appease their capitalist agenda. Sure, you could sell out to JojaMart and save yourself the pain, but then you'd lose the moral high ground‚Äîand what‚Äôs the point of playing Stardew without your farmer pride?

In short, Stardew Valley is the perfect mix of cozy escapism and existential farming dread. It‚Äôs the kind of game that makes you question your real-life productivity while also teaching you that friendship can be bought with mayo.

I played about 500 hours within the first year of being gifted this game and I haven't been normal about it ever since. The multiplayer is fun, but time doesn't pause for cutscenes (it cant, or everyone would have to wait for everyone elses' cut scenes) so the days are much shorter in multiplayer and to really appreciate the NPCs without skipping cutscenes you should play singleplayer. Each new update brings me joy; love this game :) I play it with my friend and my brothers multiplayer and all we do is bicker about who gets to spend the communal money on what and why selling all our ore during year one is bad.

Mochi-i,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Mochi-i/,"Stardew Valley: A Charming indie pixelated farming game

Stardew Valley is the cozy, indie gem that stole my heart‚Äîand countless hours of my life! From the moment you inherit your grandfather‚Äôs overgrown farm, you‚Äôre swept into a world brimming with charm, creativity, and endless possibilities. Whether you‚Äôre tilling soil, fishing in serene lakes, mining for treasures, or wooing townsfolk, this game masterfully blends relaxation with rewarding progression.

Pixel Perfection & Relaxing Rhythms

The pixel art is gorgeous , bursting with color and personality, while the soothing soundtrack (composed by developer Eric Barone) perfectly complements the game‚Äôs laid-back vibe. Seasons change with picturesque beauty, and each day feels like a new adventure‚Äîwhether you‚Äôre planting strawberries, uncovering ancient artifacts, or indulging in many of the in-game events.



Stardew isn‚Äôt just a farming sim. It‚Äôs a life simulator. Forge friendships with villagers, each with unique stories and schedules. Restore the community center with bundles of resources, tackle challenging caves, or compete in fishing contests. The game‚Äôs depth is staggering, yet never overwhelming‚Äîthanks to intuitive mechanics and a gentle learning curve.



Eric Barone‚Äôs dedication shines through constant updates, adding features like multiplayer (yes, you can farm with friends!) and quality-of-life improvements. The modding community further extends replayability, offering everything from new crops to visual overhauls.



Early-game grinding can feel slow, and some may miss a faster-paced experience. But these are small hiccups in an otherwise stellar package.



For the price of a fancy coffee, Stardew Valley offers hundreds of hours of joy. It‚Äôs a love letter to Harvest Moon fans and a testament to indie game magic.

-Make a ranch out of a farm and get a bunch of cute animals that you can pet;
-Perform tasks given by the residents of the town;
-Communicate with the residents, make friends and even find love (and then a spouse);
-Go into caves and do mining, as well as fight monsters and join a guild;

So far I've mostly been playing single player, the fishing was annoying at first but now I've gotten used to it, the farm isn't very big at the moment but I've grown and sold quite a fair amount of produce and I have a chicken coop, currently building up enough funds and resources to get other buildings and upgrades.
The characters seem to be pretty well thought out and the story is getting more interesting, I'm currently at 5 or 6 hearts with Abigail and Haley so I don't know which one I'll eventually marry LOL.
The one thing I'm not a fan of is the constant walking back and forth from the farm to other locations and having to rush back before midnight to sleep, I don't know if you can stay in the mines throughout the night and just eat energy foods or if you definitely have to get back home to sleep, I haven't tried staying there overnight yet.
I've done a little bit of multiplayer and started a co-op session with a friend, but we haven't done much more than a couple of hours of play, due to scheduling etc, but it does seem like good fun, I would definitely love to play more multiplayer co-op at some time.

bruhyx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bruhyx/,"Stardew Valley is like a vacation, but instead of a beach, you get a farm overrun with weeds and some dilapidated buildings. You inherit this farm from your grandfather (who apparently thought ""farming"" was a hobby), and now it's up to you to turn it into something that isn‚Äôt a total disaster. Plant crops, take care of animals, and figure out if it's worth watering those tomatoes or just chilling with a cup of tea on the porch.
The graphics? Not groundbreaking, but they're charming in a nostalgic, ""this feels cozy"" kind of way. There are no annoying cars, no neighbors complaining about your trash, and no bosses demanding you stay late. Just a peaceful world with some crops, a few chickens that couldn't care less about your life, and a general vibe of ""yeah, this is the world I want to live in.""
But don't think Stardew Valley is just about farming. No, no ‚Äî if you're ever tired of watering plants and picking vegetables, you can always head to the mines and fight off some weird rock monsters. It's like a local amusement park, except the rollercoaster is a pickaxe and the thrill comes from dodging giant bugs and collecting rare ores.
Not feeling the mines? No problem! You can hang out with the locals, who are as quirky as the landscape. There‚Äôs always someone to chat with, or even romance if you‚Äôre feeling bold (don‚Äôt worry, the game doesn't judge). Sure, you won‚Äôt be hitting the city for dinner anytime soon, but you‚Äôll have a farm full of animals and a bunch of new friendships.
In short, Stardew Valley is the perfect game to relax and forget about the real world. There are no deadlines, no stress, just you, your farm, and a bunch of activities where you can be the best farmer around. And if you want a little action, you can always visit the mines and get lost fighting monsters. Or, you know, just remember to water your plants once in a while.
Perfect for when life‚Äôs got you down and all you want is some dirt under your nails and a little peace in the virtual countryside. Plus, it's got a wholesome vibe that even the busiest of ""I need my coffee"" people can appreciate.

The early stages force you to walk slowly through the map as the clock ticks, talk to NPCs and help them gather specific items. Many characters are in impredictible locations or locked inside their room so you have to come back a different day. This clashes with the idea of planning your actions, which is absolutely required for farming.

I never completed the community center bundle without cheats, though.

Angel-steam,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Angel-steam/,"Stardew Valley is like a warm hug from an old friend, a comforting escape into a world where time slows down and the simple pleasures of life take center stage. It's a game that celebrates the joys of farming, friendship, and community, wrapped up in a charming pixel art package that's as cozy as a well-worn sweater.

From the moment you step foot in Pelican Town, you're greeted with a sense of warmth and familiarity. The townsfolk are friendly and welcoming, each with their own unique personalities and stories to discover. Whether you're chatting with the gruff but lovable George, helping the shy and introverted Penny with her library duties, or sharing a laugh with the jovial and boisterous Gus, you'll quickly find yourself forming genuine connections with these virtual neighbors.

But it's not just the characters that make Stardew Valley so special; it's the sense of purpose and fulfillment that comes with tending to your farm. There's something deeply satisfying about planting seeds, watering crops, and watching them grow into bountiful harvests. The game's farming mechanics are simple yet engaging, with a satisfying progression system that rewards your hard work with new tools, seeds, and upgrades.

And let's not forget about the festivals! From the Flower Dance to the Night Market, these special events add a layer of excitement and community to the game. Whether you're competing in a fishing contest, dancing with a potential love interest, or simply enjoying the festivities with your friends, these events are a highlight of the Stardew Valley experience.

But perhaps the greatest strength of Stardew Valley is its ability to provide a much-needed escape from the stresses of real life. In a world that often feels chaotic and overwhelming, this game offers a peaceful sanctuary where you can lose yourself in the simple pleasures of farming, fishing, and building relationships. It's a game that encourages you to slow down, savor the moment, and appreciate the beauty of the world around you.

So, if you're looking for a game that will warm your heart, soothe your soul, and remind you of the simple joys of life, look no further than Stardew Valley.

Please note, this review is based on a play through of the game with no mods

I had heard about Stardew Valley from a lot of friends through the years. I was told that this was a game well worth my time, but it was a title that I allowed to let slip by because I took it for the face value graphics - and I couldn't have been more wrong for doing so. This game is a gem, a masterpiece of an art form lost to time. It's reminiscent of a bygone Nintendo era, bringing me back to this nostalgic feeling I last felt playing on my old Nintendo Game Boy on a forgotten Pok√©mon title - but this game isn't that. It's its own unique thing and that's the beauty behind it.

Your own custom character takes charge of an old farmstead and you yourself bring it back to life alongside the residents of Pelican Town. You farm, you tend the land, you tend to livestock, go fishing, explore spooky caverns, fight creepy creatures, mine, and interact with a lively and dynamic citizenry. You can trade, you can attend town events, and help them out through local job postings. There's just so much you can do in the game and only after almost 20 hours in and I feel like I've only scratched the surface of how amazing this game is.


From the start, I fell in love with the agriculture system. You till the land, you spread your fertilizer/retainer soil, and you sow the seeds, and water. I love that it's not the same seeds year around either, as the mix changes with each season, so you get this unique variety that never really becomes redundant. I'm currently experimenting with changing up what kinds of crops/plants I like to grow and have started crafting artisan items from them and profiting immensely from them. My margins from just selling the raw crops have doubled now that I've started to also create actual items from them.

I also love the dynamic feel of Pelican Town and the unique relationships with all the characters that inhabit it. Everyone has their own unique personality and there's a lovely mechanic with how you interact with them - choosing your own dialogue options - and developing (or hindering) the relationship from there. You can also marry someone you might have an eye on if you develop your relationship with them enough. I also really enjoy the different events that happen through town every month/season. It makes the entire world feel so real and really helps you connect with the Pelican Town community in its entirety. Some of the characters I really like (love Abigail's company, love Robin, don't mind the Mayor), and others I sort of really despise (not a fan of Clint, and Pierre... definitely don't like that guy), but it's all enjoyable with how those relationships develop!

I also love the sense of freedom the game conveys. While the core element of the game remains you owning a farm and choosing what you do with that farm (be it that of growing crops or raising livestock) - but there's also various other forms of income you can choose to do with. I like that you're able to make money off the spoils of your adventures in the mines, or maybe you prefer the fishing dynamics and you make money off of that, or maybe you just love to forage (albeit not as well paying). I just love that the game gives you the freedom to do with that as you please. The freedom to decorate as well - choosing how you want your home and homestead to be set up is very nice!

I also really loved the soundtrack. I hate to keep referring to an Nintendo title, but the main theme in Pelican Town reminds me so much of the Yoshi's Island theme. It's hard enough to acknowledge that it reminds me of Pok√©mon, and now I keep hearing something out of the Super Mario Bros. universe coupled with that! Love it either way because still, it's its own unique thing! It's not either of those titles!


I can't say that I hate anything about this game. I loved just about everything. There are some things I think I'd change, but for a game almost a decade since its release, I'm very very happy with what I've seen and experienced.

I will say, though, I'm not really a fan of the combat mechanic in this game. I find it very limiting that your combat is only limited to the cave explorations, and even that feels horribly redundant exploring those caves. I was expecting a lot more from the Adventurer's Guild - something akin to the Fighter's Guild from , but this felt more akin to slayer tasks from . Exploring those caves feels like just a side effect/necessity of mining for resources and I honestly wish there was more to it.

The day and hour mechanic drives me nuts. Some days I have either too much to do in a day and some days I have too little to do. Specifically, I'm not a fan with how as soon as 2am rolls around, and if I'm not in bed by then, my character plops down asleep and I get mugged or dropped at the expensive doctor in town. Either way, you pay a hefty monetary fine and I just feel like it's a strange penalty mechanic when there should be other ways to stave off that time mechanic - hell, if only 3am was allowed as the limit, it'd save so much time on my end.

This is more of a nitpick on my end, but I wish there was a clearer framework of what opportunities are unlocked as you raise your farming skills and such. For example, I didn't know that I had to build a mayonnaise machine to turn the eggs my chickens produce into mayonnaise after I built the coop. I'm making very good profits now from the mayonnaise, but I wish I had known that sooner instead of selling the eggs for paltry sums. I just wish it was a little more explicit - but I'm also probably not looking into it hard enough or maybe it's locked behind one of those bookstore books. Just a personal nitpick.


delivers a unique experience that is reminiscent of a time long gone of Nintendo handhelds. Had I been much younger when this came out, I probably would've picked it up sooner - but I can confirm that it's still an awesome joy, even as an adult. I haven't tried the co-op mode, but I really want to play with my friends now that I know it exists! It's just so much fun.

If you're on the fence about this, do yourself a favor and give it a chance. Don't let the graphics fool you, this game is a gem and deserves one honest playthrough. You won't regret it - and if you do - at least you can say you tried it!",Recommended,5185,116.6 hrs on record,"Posted: October 19, 2024"
7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046513274/,"Developed by a single developer for more than 4 years, Stardew Valley is a top-down, roleplaying, farming simulation game, and somehow much more.

As you start the game you create your character as you see fit, choose favorite pet and the style of farm (and its name), and you can also customize some game mechanics and multiplayer options.

The initial premise of this game is the inheritance of a farm and after a non-disclosed amount of time working in an office job, your character decides to move to said farm only to find it covered by overgrown weeds. It‚Äôs up to the player to decide what will be the best course of action to take.

Alongside the different crops the player can chose to grow, there is also animals to raise, different characters to meet (and date if so inclined), items to collect, a museum to fill with interesting items, a mine with monsters to delve and fight, fishing, and a mystery surrounding the town. As the player explores and choses any given activity to develop, skill points are gained to improve specific actions.

The game is divided into seasons, and there are different weather conditions that change how some activities are played. Special events also occur in some specific moments of the game following the internal calendar.

The game can be controlled with keyboard and mouse or controller, with customizations of keys. There are also plenty of options to make the experience more comfortable, like autorun and audio options.

Updated over the years, and adding a bigger crew to the game, it‚Äôs a very polished experience with great pixel art graphics and great soundtrack.

Considering the many ways this game can be played, mostly all very relaxing, I highly recommend Stardew Valley.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198102119431/,"Fantastic game that I can spend hours playing, genuinely.

Stardew Valley is a really relaxing farm sim with game-play that essentially allows you to form/shape the farm into however you want whilst also encouraging you to try other game-play mechanics. Each aspect of the game awards you for playing and exploring new things and with each update that comes out your farm is given more and more customisation options. If you don't like some things, there's a really big modding community that gives everything a fresh coat of paint, so you very rarely ever lose anything with this game.

As for story/characters ? The lineup of characters feel very fresh ! Characters all with established flaws and stories you can get through their dialogue, they all have such distinguishable lives and stand out from one another that you can explore, and you get awarded for befriending some of the townsfolk with gifts and events that let you see their characters more in-depth. The romance options available for the game give just about everyone/anyone a person they can connect to in some way, and it feels especially refreshing to see openly queer-characters in a game and how some characters have their dialogues change to adapt to same-sex relationships.
If romance isn't for you ? You got krobus too ! :D

I can't stress enough genuinely how enjoyable this game is and how i'd encourage anyone into farming sims if they do not have this game to buy it immediately, you do not miss out on anything having this game ! :D",Recommended,1256,490.2 hrs on record,"Posted: June 7, 2024"

All sorts of things are offered including farming, foraging, mining, fishing and etc. Besides, marriage is also available. Each NPCs background is written in details and allows you to get to know them better once the relationship is close enough.
I personally enjoyed mining and slashing monster the most after I gained my legendary item. Countless maps and gameplay are offered to the player and it allows the player to play according to their preference (you could craft your own type of juice/wine, clothes, rings, etc.) If you`re the type who enjoys quiet and soothing game, this will definitely be your one!

In my opinion, this game is not just a simple farming simulator that asks players to farm, raise livestock, and build good relationships with the local residents, but it also has many other unique aspects. If you really read every dialogue, you will find uniqueness in each character's personality. Each affinity event also shows the problems each character is experiencing, which I think is relatable to real life. This part of the game, I really love it.

The gameplay, music, and art style in this game also reinforce to the players that this is a relaxing game that can be enjoyed anytime. However, I don't really like the character portraits.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198155736948/,"As you can probably tell by the obscene number of hours I‚Äôve put into this game, I thoroughly enjoy playing it. Stardew is the top tier cozy game for me. If there ever was a game I‚Äôd call addictive, it‚Äôs this one. Literally every single person I talked to about this game said the same thing: they started playing and got *hooked*.

When I initially played the game, I did everything by the book. Collected all the things, befriended all the people, etc. The game is downright adorable, so I had a lot of fun discovering every little corner of the map, every little thing Stardew Valley has to offer. There is a surprising number of things to do. Depending on what you end up liking best, you can end up with very different farms by the time you are a few (in-game) years into the game.
Maybe you are more into taking care of the cute animals, maybe gardening and crops is more your thing. Or maybe it‚Äôs fishing or monster hunting. Heck, even foraging is a solid option. The game plays out of the course of a year (well, as many years as you feel like playing, but you get what I mean), so there are four different seasons. Each offers unique crops, unique fish, unique foraging items. There are even seasonal in game events that happen on specific days each year. Concerned Ape thought of so many tiny little things when making this game, it‚Äôs no wonder it came out as enjoyable as it is.
However, one of the giant selling points for Stardew that I should mention is the modding community. While the base game is tons of fun, there are so many free mods out there that allow you to tweak the game to make it a perfect fit for you. For example, I don‚Äôt really like the fishing or the socializing part of the game, so I added some mods that make those parts easier. There‚Äôs also tons of new content to be discovered, ranging from mods that will just give you a few new crops or animals to some that add entire new maps to the game. Every couple of months I tend to reinstall the game, add a new bunch of mods and then I sink a ridiculous number of hours into it again. The insane variability of the game is definitely one factor that has contributed to me enjoying the game so much. Even after more than 600 hours it doesn‚Äôt get boring because of that.
By the way, the fact that Concerned Ape is still actively updating the game too is amazing. I don‚Äôt mean just bug fixes. Update 1.6 added a lot of new content. Considering how lovely the game already was and how popular it is, he could just lean back but I applaud him for still putting so much effort in.
It‚Äôs difficult to pinpoint exactly what it is that makes Stardew just so good. It‚Äôs lovely all around with many different aspects that offer something for everybody. Honestly, when I‚Äôm having a bad mental health day, this is what I choose to play. That may or may not have something to do with the opossum wearing a pumpkin costume that I added to my game after frankensteining a few different mods together which gives me so much serotonin‚Ä¶
But yeah, this is such a chill game to sink time into. It‚Äôs so easy to lose track of just how long you‚Äôve been playing already as well. I know so many people who played this game and I don‚Äôt know a single person who didn‚Äôt enjoy it. Sure, there might be elements you don‚Äôt like, but the way the game is structured you can just ignore them. Sure, it means you might miss out on some content but if you don‚Äôt like fishing, nothing bad happens if you just *don‚Äôt*. Even if you don‚Äôt install any mods there is a lot of room for shaping the game the way you want it to be.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199526847957/,"Stardew Valley is an outstanding indie farming simulation game that has captivated millions of players since its release. Created by a single developer, ConcernedApe, the game offers a charming and nostalgic pixel-art style combined with deep and rewarding gameplay. Inspired by classics like Harvest Moon, Stardew Valley expands on the genre by giving players an incredible amount of freedom to shape their own farming experience.

At its core, the game revolves around revitalizing a neglected farm inherited from the player's grandfather. However, farming is just one aspect of the game. Players can grow crops, raise animals, mine for resources, fish, craft items, and even engage in combat while exploring dangerous caves. The variety of activities ensures that the game never feels repetitive, and there is always something new to discover.

One of Stardew Valley‚Äôs greatest strengths is its sense of community. The town of Pelican Town is filled with unique and lovable characters, each with their own personalities, backstories, and daily routines. Players can befriend the townspeople, learn about their lives, and even develop romantic relationships, leading to marriage and family life. This social aspect adds emotional depth to the game and makes the world feel truly alive.

The game‚Äôs open-ended nature allows players to progress at their own pace, creating a relaxing and stress-free experience. There‚Äôs no right or wrong way to play‚Äîwhether you focus on running a highly profitable farm, completing the Community Center tasks, or simply enjoying the beautiful countryside, Stardew Valley accommodates all playstyles.

Another major highlight is the multiplayer mode, which lets friends work together to build and manage a farm. This cooperative element enhances the experience, making it even more enjoyable for those who love playing with others.

With its charming art style, captivating soundtrack, and nearly endless gameplay possibilities, Stardew Valley stands out as one of the best indie games ever made. Whether you're a fan of farming simulations, RPGs, or simply looking for a cozy and immersive escape, this game is a must-play.

barishizm,https://steamcommunity.com/id/barishizm/,"Stardew Valley is a great alternative for those tired of classic action games. If you're looking for a relaxing and sweet game, this one is perfect for you. Here are some tips I've learned about the game:

General Advice
Don't Cut the Grass: Before getting into livestock farming, don't cut the grass because it can be used as hay once you've built a silo. One piece of hay is worth 50g.

Watch TV: Watch your TV every day. On Sundays, you can learn new recipes from the cooking show. Some days there might be programs that give you useful information about the game.

Animals
Chicken: Once grown, it lays eggs every day. After a while, it might start giving large eggs.

Duck: Once grown, it lays eggs or feathers every other day.

Rabbit: Gives wool every 4 days.

Cow: Once grown, it produces milk every day. After a while, it might start giving large milk.

Goat: Once grown, it produces goat milk every other day. After a while, it might start giving large goat milk.

Sheep: Gives wool every 4 days.

Pig: Collects truffles. If you leave them outside every day, they will find at least 1 truffle (sometimes 2). They are useless in winter or on rainy days because animals don‚Äôt leave the barn.

Void Chicken: You can obtain it by incubating an egg you buy from Krobus in the sewer. Lays eggs every day.

Dinosaur: You can find an egg in the mines at a certain level in the desert. By placing this egg in the incubator in your coop, you can get a pet dinosaur.

Slime: Not very useful, so I don't recommend having them.

Golden Chicken and Ostrich: These are new animals added with the 1.5 update.

Mining
Luck: Before going mining, check the fortune teller on your TV to see your luck for the day.

Health Elixir: Before heading to the mines, prepare health elixirs using mushrooms.

Energy Replenishment: When tired, you can go to the spa, which opens after the earthquake, to replenish your energy.

Desert Mine: After completing the vault room in the community center, the bus service is restored, allowing you to go to the mines in the desert.

Fishing
Fishing Rod: You can start fishing by buying a rod from the fisherman at the beach. The fishing mechanic is quite simple.

Fish Species: Some fish only appear during certain seasons, in specific locations, and at specific times. For details, you can check the game‚Äôs wiki page.

Farming
Seasonal Crops: You can grow different crops each season. However, crops will wither at the end of the season, so be mindful when buying seeds.

Repairing the Greenhouse: You can repair the greenhouse by completing the tasks at the community center. In the greenhouse, crops won't wither, and you can plant anytime.

Social Relationships
Relationships: You can find out what gifts each character likes by checking the wiki page. Once you have an 8-heart relationship with a character, you can give them a bouquet to start dating. To get married, you can buy a pendant from the old mariner on rainy days.

Community Center
Tasks: By completing tasks at the community center, you can earn useful rewards.

Skills and Levels
Skills: You can improve your farming, fishing, mining, foraging, and combat skills. At levels 5 and 10, you can choose special skills.

Trait Changing: After donating to the library, you‚Äôll receive a key that opens the sewer, where you can change your traits at a statue.

One of the best games in existence. This is by far the epitome of farming cozy simulator. I've been playing this game for WAY too long and there's not much I can say negative about this game. You play as a character that leaves their terrible corporate job to go to your grandfather's crumbling farm to build it back up while engaging with the local town and villagers. Endless fun, multiple play through options, multiplayer options, multiple romance options, multiple farm options. You'll sink HOURS into this game and with multiple play through.

PROS:
* Banger soundtrack that is both fun, cozy, not annoying, and gives off good vibes
* Able to shut off flashy lights for epilepsy issues
* Full controller support
* Easy UI
* Multiplayer Options (currently up to 8 players)
* Heterosexual, homosexual, and non-binary relationships
* Multiple farm layouts to choose from
* Modifiable game
* All villagers have both positive and negative attributes to them, making them more believable and relatable
* Fun housing, shed, and farm design ability
* Lots of story and quests to complete

CONS:
* Can only pick between male or female gender
* I wish you could increase your movement speed sooner in the game (1.6+ update helps with this)
* No voice acting (though honestly it doesn't need it)
* Jojo Mart path seems less beneficial to story play through
* No ability to customize walls in barns/coops
* I personally wish there was more OG NPCs (but can increase with Stardew Expanded mod)

sosidafnu,https://steamcommunity.com/id/sosidafnu/,"I hope I have played enough hours now so that I can draw all the conclusions about this game. Well, let's get started.

First of all, I want to thank the creator of this game for the soundtracks. They give an immersion into this very atmosphere of a mysterious valley. I especially liked the theme with Junimo and the Mermaid song. It turned out very soulful.

Game logic. In this world, no one runs after our character and we comprehend everything ourselves, everyone has their own affairs and concerns. It's very realistic. The mayor, out of friendship with our grandfather, left a packet of seeds and then decide for yourself what to do with it.

As in real life, we learn all the wisdom of everyday life by chance. Somewhere something fell out, something was suggested and turned out to be important, but some information would be better not to find out (For example, the adventures of Lewis and Marnie through the bushes).

Troubles like a fence broke, lightning burned the apple tree that we grow with all our love, the seed extractor failed, or again it was not possible to process the garbage into something valuable. It is very realistic that there are good days and not so good days. Our character may simply be out of sorts.

It‚Äôs nice that the residents open up gradually; some immediately let you in, while others burrow deeper into their shells. Everyone has different character, preferences and interests. You understand that there are no blanks there, these are full-fledged individuals who have reactions to all events.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198009762950/,"Stardew Valley. It's the game that asks the profound question: ""What if your crippling office job was replaced by the gentle tyranny of farming?"" You inherit your grandpa's old plot of land in a place called Pelican Town, and suddenly you're thrust into a world of parsnips, pixelated perfection, and the nagging suspicion that everyone in town is way more socially adjusted than you are.

Let's talk about that pixel art. It's like someone took all the good parts of a classic SNES game and sprinkled them with fairy dust. Every blade of grass, every adorable little chicken, every suspiciously cheerful villager is rendered in glorious, vibrant detail. You almost want to reach into the screen and feel the digital dirt between your fingers.

And the atmosphere? Cozy doesn't even begin to cover it. Stardew Valley is like being wrapped in a warm, pixelated blanket. The music is soothing, the days are structured yet relaxed, and there's a constant sense of gentle progress. You start with a few seeds and a rusty hoe, and before you know it, you're running a thriving agricultural empire, befriending (and maybe marrying) the locals, and delving into mysterious mines.

You'll spend your days farming, fishing, foraging, and fighting the occasional grumpy radish. You'll become a master of resource management, juggling crops, livestock, and the ever-present need to upgrade your tools. You'll attend town festivals, where you can show off your prize-winning pumpkin or engage in some light-hearted flirting. You might even uncover ancient secrets or battle the forces of corporate evil (because even paradise has its problems).

But the best part? There's no pressure. You can play at your own pace, whether that means min-maxing your farm for maximum profit or spending the entire day chasing butterflies and trying to catch that one elusive legendary fish. Stardew Valley is a game about finding your own slice of happiness, one pixelated turnip at a time.",Recommended,1648,98.4 hrs on record,"Posted: November 27, 2024"

There's a sense of accomplishment in nurturing crops from seeds to harvest, but the real magic lies in the connections you forge. The townspeople, brimming with personality and quirks, became friends I cared about. Witnessing their stories unfold and the town come alive with each season brought a warmth I didn't expect from a game.

"" Stardew Valley "" is such a chill farming sim. Last summer, I legit spent whole days and nights just taking care of my farm, mining for resources, and building relationships with the residents of Pelican Town. The graphics might look simple and pixelated at first, but they're actually super charming and cozy. And don‚Äôt even get me started on the music and sound effects‚Äîthey totally add to the relaxing vibe.
It honestly felt like the perfect escape from real life. Time just flew by while I played. There‚Äôs always something to do, so it never gets boring.

P.S. I‚Äôm obsessed with fishing in this game. <33

Valhiir,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Valhiir/,"**Title: A Heartwarming and Addictive Escape into Farm Life**

**Rating: ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ‚òÖ (5/5)**

Stardew Valley is the kind of game that sneaks up on you. At first glance, it may seem like just another farming simulator, but in reality, it‚Äôs a deeply immersive experience that combines farming, exploration, relationships, and even a touch of magic. Whether you're looking for a relaxing, chill game or something that will slowly suck you into hours of gameplay, Stardew Valley is a perfect blend of both.

**Gameplay:**
At its core, Stardew Valley is about managing and growing your own farm. You inherit a dilapidated farm from your grandfather and set out to make it thrive. But farming is only part of the fun. You‚Äôll plant crops, raise animals, mine for ores, fish, craft items, and decorate your farm‚Äîeach task feels rewarding, especially when you see the fruits of your labor (literally). The progression is satisfying, and there‚Äôs always something to do. Whether it‚Äôs tending to your crops, working toward upgrades, or improving relationships with the townsfolk, the game keeps you engaged without feeling overwhelming.

The beauty of Stardew Valley lies in how it allows you to play at your own pace. Want to focus on farming? Go for it. Prefer to explore the mines or dive into the story? You can do that too. The game never forces you into a single playstyle, and that flexibility is a huge part of its charm.

**Community and Relationships:**
One of the standout features of Stardew Valley is the social aspect. The town of Pelican Town is full of quirky and lovable characters, each with their own backstory and personality. Building relationships with the townsfolk is a major part of the game, and it‚Äôs genuinely enjoyable to learn about each character and see how your actions influence their lives. Whether it‚Äôs giving someone their favorite gift, completing their quests, or even attending festivals, the game does a wonderful job of making the player feel connected to the world.

As you improve friendships (or romances), you unlock new interactions, heartwarming moments, and even marriage options. The sense of community in Stardew Valley is one of the things that sets it apart from other similar games.

**Exploration and Adventure:**
Beyond the farm and the town, the game offers plenty of opportunities for exploration. The mines provide a fun dungeon-crawling experience where you can battle monsters, collect precious resources, and uncover hidden treasures. Fishing in various parts of the map is relaxing, and there‚Äôs a great deal of satisfaction in completing the in-game fish collection.

The game also features a rich set of side activities, from seasonal events to treasure hunts, which keeps things feeling fresh. The added bonus of the game having a dynamic day-night cycle and changing seasons ensures that there‚Äôs always something new to look forward to.

**Visuals and Audio:**
The pixel art style of Stardew Valley is simple but charming. The bright, colorful landscapes are full of character, and the attention to detail in the world-building makes it feel alive. Each season brings its own unique aesthetic, whether it‚Äôs the vibrant greens of spring, the fiery oranges of fall, or the quiet, snowy winter months. It‚Äôs the kind of game that‚Äôs just fun to look at.

The soundtrack is equally delightful. The calm, relaxing tunes perfectly complement the game's laid-back atmosphere, and there‚Äôs a great sense of peace that comes with hearing the music while working on your farm or strolling through town. It‚Äôs music you‚Äôll find yourself humming long after you‚Äôve closed the game.

**Replayability:**
Stardew Valley is incredibly replayable, thanks to its open-ended gameplay and variety of ways to approach the game. Each playthrough feels different depending on what you choose to focus on, and the game‚Äôs calendar system, changing seasons, and random events mean that no two years are exactly the same. You can always set new goals for yourself, whether it's reaching a specific farming milestone, upgrading your home, or completing the community center bundles. The game‚Äôs depth ensures that there‚Äôs always something new to discover or aim for.

**Final Thoughts:**
Stardew Valley is one of those rare games that strikes the perfect balance between relaxation and challenge. It‚Äôs a game you can dive into to unwind, but it also has layers of depth that keep you coming back for more. Whether you‚Äôre tending to your farm, building friendships, or exploring the vast world, the game offers something for everyone. It‚Äôs a labor of love that shines through in every pixel and every interaction, making it an absolute must-play for anyone who enjoys heartwarming, immersive experiences.

Every time I walk into Pierre‚Äôs shop, I expect a standing ovation. Do I feel shame? No. I feel power.

I started this game thinking it would be a chill farming sim. Now I‚Äôm an unstoppable capitalist overlord who owns half the town, regularly mines at midnight, and gives Pierre competition so intense I‚Äôm practically Bezos with a pitchfork.

Here‚Äôs how bad it‚Äôs gotten: Steam sent me an achievement called ‚ÄòA Big Help,‚Äô and I started tearing up. Some guy named Shane told me I‚Äôm his only friend. Do you know what it‚Äôs like to emotionally carry a grown man while trying to win the egg hunt? Because I do.

Happy New Year, by the way! If your resolution was to spend less time staring at screens, Stardew Valley will destroy you. But hey, at least your virtual grandpa will be proud. Mine literally visited me as a ghost and said, ‚ÄòGood job,‚Äô and honestly? Best compliment I‚Äôve ever received.

This game isn't just about farming, it's about finding a little piece of magic in every corner, esp when it comes to Sebastian! :) He's the brooding, motorcycle-riding genius who somehow manages to steal your heart with every sarcastic remark. You'll spend your days planting crops, raising animals, and your nights dreaming about a future with him... the guy who's way cooler than your average farmhand. From the moment you meet him, it's very clear.. YOU'RE SMITTEN, and who wouldn't be? :) Oh, and the farm? It's adorable too.",Recommended,487,55.4 hrs on record,"Posted: December 20, 2024"
