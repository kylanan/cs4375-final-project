7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198969190268/,"EDIT: as of today 3.10.24 cs devs decided to release the most shamefull update and instead of operation (that a lot of people have been waiting for) they released a 16$ pass with no coin, no mission, no new maps, no new game modes what a joke, last operation Riptide cost 15$ and you could get 100 stars from it + coin and missions, now they wanna charge 16$ for only 40 stars ridiculous, ubisoft and ea should learn from valve how to rip the of their playerbase. Yet we are somehow STILL IN SEASON 1 OF PREMIER!!! Halooooo it's been a year.

Let’s be real: CS2 is an absolute disaster. If you think otherwise, you need to dive back into legacy CSGO to understand how a real game feels.
The fundamentals of CS2 are laughably worse; CSGO runs smoother, feels better, and offers movement that isn’t a clunky mess. You don’t have to take my word for it - most pro players have openly admitted that CSGO is superior in virtually every aspect except for graphics. The optimization in CSGO is the result of years of meticulous polishing, while CS2 feels like a half-baked joke that can’t afford to take its time. If it doesn’t improve at lightning speed, it’s destined to wither away and die.

People are rapidly losing faith in this entire project. It’s a sinking ship, and Valve seems completely oblivious to the chaos around them. Meanwhile, out-of-touch investors continue to throw money at Valve, clinging to the belief that the company will deliver the ""next big thing"" - whether it’s an operation, a major update, or something else entirely. This speculation might eventually bear fruit, but for now, it’s the only thing driving the recent spike in skin prices - not any real improvements in gameplay or the anti-cheat system. And don’t even get me started on the absurd slogan “what you see is what you get.” It’s a total farce, especially with the whole subtick system mess. The gameplay constantly feels like it’s off by a few milliseconds, making it frustrating and inconsistent. Valve seems more interested in chasing shiny new distractions like Deadlock, which will never match the success of either CSGO or CS2. Player numbers for that game are already dropping, and let’s be honest - the initial surge was just the excitement of a new Valve release. The gameplay is dull, the graphics are mediocre at best, and frankly, it’s just boring.

Valve completely dropped the ball with CS2. They should have delayed this train wreck by a couple of years. Imagine if they had launched this version as a beta today instead of pretending it’s a finished product; it wouldn’t be nearly as disappointing. And for the love of God, the anti-cheat system is an absolute nightmare. It’s so poorly implemented that it raises serious doubts about whether Valve even cares about fairness in the game. If they don’t wake up and address these glaring issues, they risk losing the dedicated player base that has stuck around through thick and thin. It’s infuriating to watch my beloved franchise decay and wither away due to Valve’s incompetence and laziness. They rake in billions upon billions and can’t afford to expand the development team working on CS2?",Not Recommended,2605,142.6 hrs on record,"Posted: 26 September, 2024"
80H8SU,https://steamcommunity.com/id/80H8SU/,"Unfortunately, it is truly a great game ruined by cheaters.

I had a very long break from CS (and gaming in general), so I was pretty excited to get back and enjoy the gameplay. That happened to be impossible as in at least 20% of your games you'll match up against someone cheating.
Back in 2014-2017 you would also occasionally meet someone cheating, but usually on higher ranks such as LE, LEM, SMFC, GE, that's why (I think) they cheated in the first place — to get to higher ranks and stay there.

Downloading CS years later (and having 0 skill left) I was surprised to find out that now you have silvers and novas flooded with cheaters, which makes 0 sense to me — What is those guys' goal? Why are they ranked so low using cheats? So, in 2025 cheating is not something you occasionally find among high-ranks competing between each other, but rather an issue you simply cannot avoid. Among other things, this makes the game very unfriendly for newbies who expect to play against someone in their skill bracket.

Someone might say ""you are just bad and that's why you think others cheat"" and while I get this POV, it is simply not the case. I might not be good anymore but I certainly remember the game's physics and stuff like that. It's quite easy to detect a cheater when you played the game for the first time in 2003. (Also, a 0 level, 1 year old, 50 hours in game Steam account having 80% HS% is simply something very, very suspicious).

Also someone might say ""just don't play on Valve's servers, go to FACEIT"". Firstly, I just want to casully play the game for an hour to relax, not to be all 'competitive' and ruin other's desire to win. Secondly, why can't the game be playable ""out of the box"" with no need to have any kind of 'add-ons'?

Well, I guess enough for a 'review'. This game will forever stay in my heart as it has brought an incalculable amount of fun into my life back in the days. And it also might bring it to someone today. But unfortunately not to me.",Not Recommended,1622,"3,472.8 hrs on record",Posted: 4 February

Nik4711,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Nik4711/,"After nearly 8,000 hours in cs:go, I think it's only fair to commit to saying that I am thoroughly disappointed with CS2. The game has taken the gripping core concept of a counter-strike game, and built around it with the primary goal of building esports and cosmetic frameworks to generate revenue. There have been numerous requests for changes that should have been prioritized, with no exaggeration, since 2015. Anti-cheat and tickrate have been eschewed to spend time developing cosmetics and designing gameplay within the skins economy rather than engaging with the gameplay of the core game. And with all this extra revenue, you really can't afford 128 tick, even just for premier or paying premier players?

The disrespect the continued non-development of the game itself reflects upon the community and the spirit that keeps the game alive should long ago have fractioned the playerbase, but the way back has been walled off by removing csgo from steam (possibly one of the most dishonest, anti-consumer moves i've ever seen). There is nothing honest going on at valve when it comes to cs2, and nothing elevating this game beyond a general shooter other than the allowance from valve for us measly customers to still interact with the core mechanics of counter-strike. perhaps they'll slowly sculpt this game into something decent, but the philosophy and principles pushing the counter-strike project at valve have long since left the realm of mechanics and passion for greener* pastures.",Not Recommended,1256,"8,577.9 hrs on record","Posted: October 8, 2024"

steamydogshit,https://steamcommunity.com/id/steamydogshit/,"It's completely filled to the brim with cheaters.

Update 1/21/25:
- Unskilled players are now using DMA (Direct Memory Access) PCI Cards to cheat
- Combined with a second PC - a DMA card slotted in PC A sends realtime memory to PC B which can then be read/analyzed/acted upon
- PC B can simply read the memory on PC A, and can send realtime undetectable ESP onto PC A when combined with a display fuser
- DMA Card when also combined with a M&K Controller (""KMBox""), PC B can send realtime inputs (Aimbot, Triggerbot, etc) to PC A
- DMA Card can be repeatedly flashed with new firmware making detection near impossible
- There is an entire black market for undetectable firmware
- Valve doing nothing about these DMA Cards on top of not even issuing a statement shows they simply do not care about the ""elite competitive experience""
- Valve will take action against legitimate players finding a loophole in the Armory Pass, and in a few hours - but will not take any concrete action against players abusing the entire game (hacking) and for years

- VAC is the worst anti-cheat in existence. Valve takes HWID of users however, they will not ban based on HWID. They only ban by account so the hacker can just make a new one and do it all over again.
- Valve is making a huge profit off NOT banning hackers. When a hacker gets their account banned, they just get another one and purchase prime ($15). Valve clearly sees this as a revenue source and will never actually take any real action against cheaters.
- There is a secondary market for leveling fresh accounts to premiere and selling them, people use inexpensive hacks to level accounts and then re-sell them for more
- People are running automated AI-based bots that can dupe weapons and automatically cheat same as in TF2
- Premiere game mode is completely off balance. Once you reach 10k+ ELO your matches will only net you ~50-100 ELO and you will lose between ~300-1000 every game. Complete timesink.
- Valve's ""subtick"" is garbage. The game will always have peeker's advantage - if you have a high ping around around 50ms-100ms you will always have that much more time to see someone on your screen before they will see you
- Public ""find a group"" feature is filled with Russians posing as ""professional"" players who invite you to lobbies, try to get you into a discord channel and then socially engineer you to ""signup for their team"" which is a steam account phishing page.

Game is still fun and a classic - but is clearly still in an alpha development stage. Valve trying to claim or boast that CS2 is a ""competitive"" shooter is completely invalid. Any ""competitive"" teams are phony. Faceit, ESEA and competitive game modes all filled with blatant cheaters. You could dump years of time into this game trying to ""git gud"" but you will never beat the script kiddies let alone be able to keep up with the constant updates to the game mechanics.

Ah, Counter-Strike 2. The long-awaited, heavily hyped, Source 2-powered evolution of the greatest tactical shooter of all time. And what did we get? A broken mess that makes you appreciate Counter-Strike: Global Offensive—a game we all spent years complaining about.

First, let's talk about the servers. You ever wanted to experience what it’s like to time travel? Well, now you can! Thanks to CS2’s incredible sub-tick system, every gunfight feels like you're guessing where the past version of your opponent might be, while the future version of yourself is already dead. Laggy peeks, input delay, and rubberbanding galore—it’s like Valve found the worst possible way to implement online gameplay and ran with it.

Then, we have the cheaters. Oh boy. If you ever dreamed of playing against professional aimlock enthusiasts in every second game, CS2 has you covered. The VAC system? Think of it as a museum piece—nice to look at but completely useless. Mass reporting doesn’t work, the cheaters never get banned, and somehow, they always win. It's almost impressive.

But don’t worry, CS2 did bring improvements! They gave us volumetric smokes—because that’s what everyone wanted, right? Not better matchmaking, not reliable hit registration, but dynamic, 3D smokes that look cool while you get shot through them by someone using wallhacks.

Meanwhile, Valorant exists, a game that actually runs well, has anti-cheat that does something, and doesn’t make you question if your bullets are real or just imaginary suggestions to the game engine.

Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is like getting a birthday gift from Valve where they take away your old toy and give you a newer, shinier, but completely broken version of it. 0/10 experience when playing, 10/10 experience when uninstalling.",Not Recommended,1548,"2,413.1 hrs on record",Posted: February 20

The reality is that real anticheat will never come, vacnet will never stop learning and vac will stay useless as it always was. The issue with anti cheat goes back to 2014 and since then vacnet is learning and valve is ""making"" an anticheat.

It's sad that a game with legendary status has such uninterested developers. Half of the game is made up of community made maps, skins and tournaments that are hosted by third parties. Only thing that valve needs to do is make a stable and functional game with an anticheat and they refuse to do that. It's not that they can't make an anticheat they are not an indie studio they are multi billion dollar company that doesn't want to make an anticheat.

Cons:
Subtick feels like everyone is just lerping.
Lack of community server support
Lack of VAC/Overwatch ""presence""

Comments:
I just really hope the dev team gets the support they need to make this the best game possible. CSGO at the end was so polished and it feels like we went back in time to 2012 and have to start all over. I never fully grasped the purpose of the rebrand. CS 1.6, CS CZ, CSS, CSGO were all stand alone games, and CS2 should be as well. Each game has its place and if the main concern is skins then that sounds like they should probably not encourage sketchy gambling within their game. Plenty of games thrive without a ""market"".

As a long-time Counter Strike player, I am deeply frustrated with the current state of Counter Strike 2. Despite its potential, the game is plagued by hackers.

Hackers Everywhere:
You can hardly join a lobby without encountering multiple hackers.
They blatantly use wallhacks and aimbots, delivering headshots through smokes as if they weren’t there, ruining the experience for everyone else.

Inadequate Measures by Steam/VALVE:
Despite numerous reports, Steam / VALVE seem to take no effective action.
The report button feels useless, serving more as a decorative element in the interface ?!

Loss of Game Quality:
The fun and challenge that the game once offered are gone. Instead, most of the time is spent being annoyed by obvious cheaters and hoping that VALVE will finally take effective action.

Conclusion:
Counter Strike 2 has potential, but the hacker problem is destroying it.
VALVE needs to implement effective anti-cheat measures urgently.

There are way too many hackers around. While they are getting kicked at casual games, they are NOT getting kicked at competetive/premier games. Throwing a game because a hacker is in your team does not happen. At all!

I pay top money to get high speed / low ping (4ms) connection. However this seems to be completely useless in CS2.

averagealcoholic332,https://steamcommunity.com/id/averagealcoholic332/,"Counter-Strike 2 was supposed to be the evolution of CS:GO. A fresh engine, better graphics, smoother gameplay. In reality? It's a downgrade in disguise. Sure, the core gunplay still slaps, the maps look cleaner, and Source 2 brings a nice visual upgrade. But once you scratch the surface, the issues hit you like a flashbang to the face.

🔸 CS:GO was just better. More features, better balance, less chaos. CS2 feels like a stripped-down, half-baked remake with prettier lighting. It lacks the polish and reliability that made CS:GO feel like home.

🔸 Cheaters. Everywhere. Despite all the “improved anti-cheat” talk from Valve, CS2 is swarming with wallhackers, spinbotters, and aim-assisted clowns. VAC is more of a meme than a system. You might get one clean match out of five – if you're lucky.

🔸 Account leaks through streams. Let that sink in – people literally lost their Steam accounts just by watching CS2 streams on Twitch. No phishing, no clicking shady links – just watching a major event. And Valve? Dead silent. No statement, no apology, no help.

🔸 Server quality is laughable. 64 tick servers in 2025 is just unacceptable. We were promised 128 tick – we got smoke gimmicks and laggy peeks. Rubberbanding, packet loss, and straight-up disconnects still happen. It’s like playing on a potato sometimes.

🔸 Missing content at launch. CS2 launched like an early-access game. No community servers, no classic modes, missing features from CS:GO that players used every day. And they’re slowly trickling back... keyword: slowly.

🔸 Matchmaking and ranks are a joke. The ranking system feels totally random. Win streak? You derank. Lose a game? Here's your promotion. No transparency, no logic – just vibes and suffering.

Final thoughts:
Counter-Strike 2 could be amazing. The gameplay foundation is still gold – it's fast, competitive, and adrenaline-pumping. But Valve has a long way to go before this game deserves to stand above CS:GO.

At the moment, I play CS2 not because it’s great, but because there's no real alternative. And deep down, I still miss CS:GO – the better, more complete version of the game I fell in love with.

The fixes to the inconsistent character animations are appreciated, but besides that you don't get any real value from this update. You can buy a glorified Battle Pass that costs you 16€ to earn points to allow you to again GAMBLE for skins, like you're opening chests, to have a chance to get something decent. Once all the 40 points you get for the Armor Pass are used up, you'll have to buy a new one, in case you didn't get the skin you wanted, tough luck!

Oh and you can buy Armor Pass limited Cases which, you've guessed it, still have to be unlocked with keys. Grabbing a new charm to dangle on your weapon to distract you from the fact that you're still waiting for content? How about removing it to stick it somewhere else? Oh that's a shame, please pay for a toolset to replace it.

I've been holding up hope for some reworked maps or new ones, but Valves leaves the community creators on their own creating the maps that they then get to put in the game. Now we get an update to pay for more stuff, for what? What are we paying for? Just the server fees? Where is our money going to valve? What are you developing that needs this budget? Hopefuly some of our money will go to the skin creators which designs you're putting in your cases.

This feels like another spit in the face of dedicated players, Counterstrike fans have to have a tough skin, but after more than 10 years my patience is running thin.

Views: 49,435
VALVE cancelled the Counter-Strike fan mod Classic Offensive. After eight years of development and after being approved by Steam Greenlight in 2017, VALVE has ordered the developers of Classic...
The short version is:



Personally speaking, I think that the involved representatives for/in Valve have acted disgracefully regarding this project. One moment, the project is greenlit. The next, the team cannot receive any response from any representative for/in Valve regarding the project's compliance with changing requirements. Then once they are at the finish line & ready for release, the team is being told to withhold from releasing their work entirely. I can only hope that this is indeed a misunderstanding between departments as the lead developer of experiencing while trying to release the on Steam, but considering Valve's increasingly ""closed-off"" nature regarding & specifically, I am not getting my hopes up that this is the case.

In the deeply unfortunate event that Valve continues to disallow the work done for from being released via any & all means, I can only hope that they will at least clearly & consistently communicate with such projects as the-built-from-the-ground-up-on-Valve's-public-Source-S.D.K.-2013 going forward and avoid wasting the hard work & time by all involved as they have done so completely for the Team.

I otherwise have nothing that I can say regarding itself as I have never played it, have no desire to play it and only take interest in it regarding technical developments & assets as I did for before it. I'm just taking what opportunity I have to join the voice of disapproval for the poor communication & choices made in regards to the years of work done by the Team.",Not Recommended,1980,16.9 hrs on record,Posted: May 8

ViralCancer,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ViralCancer/,"I have been playing counter-strike since it was a mod, before Valve bought the rights and before steam was even a thing. I have had no issues until CS:GO where hackers seemed to go unchecked and if you tried to report anyone valve wouldn't let you for a time and said they have a full proof anti-cheat method. CS2 was coming out and I was excited for it since it would be an upgrade to visuals and gameplay. It has some improvements but hackers are still a problem more in comp and premier than in casual surprisingly.

Steam from the articles I have read are using AI and a report from another player to catch cheaters now, this however is showing false positives, there are videos discussing this in more detail where the number of ""caught"" cheaters has increased exponentially. I myself have not cheated in any game, ran any scripts, etc. Yet I have now been punished twice in two different pods of 5 despite no actual vac bans and no word on who was even suspected of cheating, instead we get a generic message of ""Irregular Gameplay"" and the whole team is penalized. First time was 20 hours, I figured I just won't play with those guys again as I only knew one of them anyways. The second time I met 3 clan guys friended one of them and ran with one of their friends and the match ended early. We were losing both matches by a lot and we suspected the top frag player on the other team of hacking given how great he was compared to everyone else. The second time was a 3 day cooldown and since I don't hack I opened a steam ticket and almost 3 days later there is no response. I have spent a lot of money on opening cases and everything so I find it very crappy that Steam/Valve has decided to ignore my ticket and derank me a second time on premier when I was not cheating at all.

I have friends who play premier and I want to play with them which is why I was getting my rank up which peak was around 3500 which isn't very high. Most of my friends got theirs up to 10k+ and the game doesn't allow you to play if the level difference is too high, which I understand the reason is so players don't get boosted. My issue now is that I am forced to play with full randos as if I join a stack, I risk getting cooldowned again or banned if someone else is cheating or has ""Irregular Gameplay"".

I will still play the game but I don't see a point in trying to do comp or premier anymore nor do I see the point in spending money in a game that allows actual cheaters to play the game while penalizing those it just thinks might be cheating. This makes me want to go to back to COD but most of my friends play CS2. If you are looking for a game to play competitive this game is definitely not it.

Cheating is not the only reason not to get this game, CS2 has been out for 2 years and I was a little down that they eliminated a lot of maps, but they brought new versions at the same time. They announced they were bringing new maps, for hostage rescue, there are only 2 maps where before we had more. I would have thought that we would get 2 new hostage maps but both times they released 2 maps for a total of 4, they were defusal maps and the first two weren't for casual or comp but only wingman (2 v2). They release skins and they are nice but cheating is a problem, since Q3 of last year flagging accounts who aren't cheating has been a problem and we still only have 2 hostage maps that one has always been since beta the other since 2000, 25 years old. Meanwhile most of the defusal maps are newer or have had major upgrades to design layout.

If you already own the game, sure you can keep playing it but if Valve/Steam continues in the direction they have been headed they will destory the player base for this game. If you don't own this game, I do not recommend you buy it and purchase price is they charge money to play premier/comp, 15 dollars.

Look how they massacred my boy.

Anyway, My favorite pasta recipe

Ingrediants:
1 whole large white or vidalia onion diced
6 cloves of garlic crushed
salt pepper to taste
4 sprigs of thyme
2 sprigs rosemary
1 sprig sage
2 sprigs oregano
1 dried bay leaf
10 oz of mezze rigatoni or penne or pasta of choice cooked to box instructions
4tbsp tomato paste (preferably sun dried)
28 oz can of san marzano tomatos (from italy, maybe california, whole italian if desperate, tomato puree if really really really desperate)
1-2 tsp of calabrian chili peppers
1/4 cup of red wine
3tbps olive oil or neutral oil
3 oz heavy whipping cream
1/2 oz parmigiano reggiano plus more for garnish

fresh basil for garnish

Heat oil over medium-low heat and add sliced onion cook for 30-45 minutes until fully carmalized
Add crushed garlic and tomato paste and cook for about 30 seconds
Add 1/4 cup of wine and cook until most has cooked off about 5 minutes
Add the san marzano tomatoes, calabrian chilis, bay leaf, salt and pepper, basil, oregano
and 1/2 cup of water
Cook pasta according to box instructions and keep some of the remaining cooking water
Press down the whole tomatoes with the back of a spatula and continue to cook for another 25-35 minutes or until sauce has basically turned back into paste {If sauce thickens too quickly add the pasta water 1/4 cup at a time to level off}
Add 1oz heavy cream at a time and stir into sauce to form a golden orangish sauce and let cook for about 2 minutes to let the flavors mingle
remove sprigs from sauce
Cut the heat and add the pasta of choice to the sauce

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199006418724/,"1. If Valve doesn't fix something with Anti-cheat, then its sucks
2. The match-making system is a total blast. How can a person with 3K hours and an account that is XX years old get into the team someone who has a new account and 30 hours (with a little luck) that is unthinkable.
3. Russia and 3rd world countries should have their own server or prevent them from connecting to EU servers.

- Minus:
1. If you want to hang out after work ...... forget it
2. If you think you won't come across a cheater... forget it
3. If you want to hang out with your friends and have a little fun, it's impossible - you'll ruin your friendships because of the ""great"" hitbox system (The mouse, keyboard on the worst PC will take it away)
4. Wasted time
5. Unnecessary spended money if you buy skins or open cases (and thus feed this lousy incompetent gang - gold diggers)

3. Rusko a krajiny 3-ho sveta by mali mať vlastný server alebo zabrániť im možnosť pripojovať sa na EÚ servery .

Mínusy:
1. Ak si chceš po práci v klude zahrať ...... na to zabudni

In the beginning I played this game because it was free and popular. I was bad at it and also didn't really want to give it a try because of all the sweats and hackers.

A lot of things have changed: new skins, new graphics, new maps. That was already all the good things.

What bothers me about this game? Mostly the community. In every game I join, there is at least one sweat in the lobby, which makes getting better and gathering experience pretty much hell. Then there is the ""angry kid"" type of player who plays like a NPC and will kick you when you are too good during the game. Not to forget about the people who yell and curse on the mic nonstop.
Gambling is also a HUGE problem in this game. The prices are ridiculous, but the gambling aspect isn't my personal issue since everyone is responsible for themselves.

10 Years since the first time i've been playing CSGO and this is the first time i've meet so many cheaters! in both premier and competitive. (Remind you im not type of guy who just start yelling and saying someone is cheating because they're good.) Im not saying CSGO was a perfect game either but in CS2 ive just meet a lot of cheater in row more than in CSGO.

The ranked points sistem is also awful and unbalanced. when CS2 was introduced people keep saying it will gets balance over time, but nope it have been almost a year and the sistem still bad. How is fair for people who has rank lets just say Guardian Elite only get 5k points? if you're Nova 1 before but got lucky you can get 10k immediately. So because of this they just make a new MORE arbitrary matchmaking system. if you're new on CS2 sometimes your enemies/teammates either its have same skill as you and have the actual skills 4k players points OR just some dude who have 3000 hours who just to happen got 5k points.

This is just based on my personal experience, maybe you like the new ranked system, or maybe you just never found cheater in your match and having a good times, Then is good for you!

The game is good when is works, but for me is just pain haha

This game isn’t just a playground for hackers—it’s their personal kingdom, where they run unchecked and unchallenged. Aimbots, wallhacks, spinbots—you name it, and you’ll see it in almost every match. What’s worse is that Valve doesn’t seem to care.

VAC: A Dinosaur of Anti-Cheat Systems
Valve Anti-Cheat (VAC) is the same antiquated system they’ve been parading around for years, and it’s utterly useless in Counter-Strike 2. Cheaters laugh at it as they blatantly ruin match after match. VAC bans, if they ever come, happen weeks after the damage is done—long enough for the cheater to create a new account and start the cycle all over again. It’s not just ineffective; it’s insulting.

A Cheater's Paradise
Cheaters have become so rampant in CS2 that it feels like they outnumber legitimate players in ranked matches. The sheer audacity of some of these hackers—openly mocking their opponents while flaunting their cheats—shows just how toothless Valve’s response is. Even in supposedly ""high-rank"" games, the presence of cheaters destroys any sense of competition or fairness.

False Promises and Empty Words
Valve promised improvements to anti-cheat for CS2, but what we got is a hollow PR statement with zero tangible results. If anything, the situation has worsened. Features like kernel-level anti-cheat, used by competitors like Riot’s Vanguard, aren’t even on the table. Instead, players are left to report cheaters manually, which feels like screaming into the void.

Impact on the Community
The cheater infestation has turned the once-loyal Counter-Strike community into a bitter, disillusioned group. Legitimate players are abandoning the game in droves, leaving only the cheaters and those masochistic enough to endure this broken experience. CS2’s potential for competitive play has been utterly destroyed by Valve’s negligence.

Counter-Strike 2 isn’t just failing to deal with cheaters—it’s actively enabling them. At this point, calling the game “unplayable” is generous. Valve’s refusal to take anti-cheat measures seriously is the ultimate betrayal to its player base. This isn’t just a problem—it’s a catastrophe.",Not Recommended,1930,338.4 hrs on record,"Posted: December 9, 2024"

Herostn1c,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Herostn1c/,"Counter-Strike 2 has a unique style, similar to Counter-Strike 1.5/1.6, but there are a ton of cheaters in the game. Even when I report them through support, the response is always that it's enough in-game, but I continue to lose against cheaters. This is incredibly frustrating, especially when losing points in premier.

I recommend that Premier Points and stats should not be affected when playing against cheaters. It seems like the developers don’t care about the players’ frustration, which is ruining the game. You are hurting the community.

I’ve been playing CS since 1999, but the lack of action against cheaters is disappointing. Cheaters are not being banned, and players don’t get notifications about bans, unlike games such as PUBG. Losing to cheaters feels like a waste of time.

Deathmatches and Premier mode are both filled with cheaters, and Valve’s anti-cheat system is not effective. At the very least, use AI to detect player behavior and flag potential cheaters for investigation. Watching replays makes it clear when someone is cheating.

Why do I pay the price for developers’ failure to fix cheaters? If Valve can’t fix this, at least implement a fair system, like Rainbow Six Siege, where players get points back when cheaters ruin the game. A typical match in CS2 lasts 30-50 minutes, including overtime—am I just playing to waste my time?

I want to achieve a high Premier Rank, but it's impossible when lower ping players dominate. I don’t like shooting at a player’s head when they’re not even on my screen. Ping differences are a huge problem. For instance, with 68ms, I shouldn't have to play against someone with 1ms, which gives them an unfair advantage. Recoil and hitboxes aren't the same for everyone, making the game feel unbalanced.

At the very least, implement an MMR system based on ping—subtract 35ms from the player's current ping. I’d be okay with a 30ms difference, but anything more, like a 20ms advantage, changes the outcome of the game. My bullets don’t register properly, and I get killed due to the difference.

And then there’s support—when I report cheaters, I sometimes include a YouTube link to the video of them cheating. And what does support say? ""We can’t open the YouTube link."" Are you telling me to just shut up? Really? It's YouTube, come on! This is a vital tool to provide clear evidence, and they can’t even open it? If your platform can't provide a clean way to view replays or get media over 10MB, at least accept YouTube links.

miss__red,https://steamcommunity.com/id/miss__red/,"Long time ago, back in 2017 I used to play CS:GO on my brother's account and it was fun! Now, I mean today (23rd of August 2024), I've decided to try this ""CS2"" game, just to remind myself of old good times.

First of all, everything's changed. It's hard to get used to something, which is completely different from what you remember. What I mean by that is they've changed some maps (didn't check them all out), the menu of the game looks terrible in my opinion, the store in the game looks different. Personally I prefer old design.
Second - my laptop is weak and even if I wanted to, I wouldn't be able to play this game even with 1280x720 resolution. I understand that progress doesn't stop, graphically all games become better, technologies are going ahead. But it's sad that the developers don't think about such players/users as I am who can't afford to have a better machine to run the game.
Third - the achievements. Where are they? I enjoyed playing the game to get new achievements, it was fun and motivational.
I don't know about the cheaters/hackers problem, didn't encounter them but I see that people are complaining about them in the reviews.

In conclusion I'd like to say that the developers (Valve) ruined their own product. What they value is not the quality but money ( from tournaments, community market, gambling with skins) and it's disappointing.",Not Recommended,1136,0.6 hrs on record,"Posted: August 23, 2024"

- keychain removal tool... that has to be bought (duh, you want that for free?)
- ~14 euro battlepass that can be ""aCtIvAtEd"" (bought) 5 times so you can grind those points to ""exchange"" (gamble) for the lowest tier skins (keep dreaming of that covert AK/AWP though, it's just around the corner)

Fortnite doesn't even try to rob their playerbase that much.
Is Valve have some insane debt that I wasn't made aware of?
That is a serious shakedown.

UPDATE: VAC Anticheat is even worse than I thought. Valve won't do anything about it, but for example... let's say you have Destiny 2 or Rainbow Six Siege installed and you have BattlEye as an anticheat on your PC. VAC will detect the other anticheat on your computer and BAN you for having it. My friend currently has 4 VAC bans (and counting) because of this alone.
Absolutely atrocious that this is allowed to happen while real cheaters get away with everything. It's so obvious who has wall hacks AND aim hacks (+ etc.) and who doesn't. I'm just gonna say that much.
God forbid the REAL offenders get punished. NOPE. You get punished for having other games installed on your PC. Riiiight.

UPDATE: My friend now has 5 VAC bans as of typing this. We played in casual and comp lobbies earlier today for fun AND... guess what? They all had walls hacks. We even had a losing team leave a comp match and reconnect just so they could toggle their hacks on. Most obvious hackers ever and VAC nor Valve will punish them.

I’ve always had a soft spot for the older versions, but this version feels kind of neglected. There are cheaters everywhere, hitboxes feel off, and instead of fixing the real issues, it seems like the devs are more focused on pumping out new skins to make money.

This is especially true on European and Russian servers, where most players seem to be cheating, and CS does nothing to ban these cheaters.

purple_paws,https://steamcommunity.com/id/purple_paws/,"I've long enjoyed this game however CS2 has some pretty major problems which have yet to be resolved. I've held off writing a review since I was hoping by now that it would be in a better state.

The good
I'll start with some things I like. Contrary to how a lot of people feel, I really like the graphical changes. The game is a lot better looking, but still really smooth and consistent (at least in my experience). I also greatly prefer the transparency of having a numerical value for rank as opposed to the categorical ranks of CSGO.

This game has two major issues though which I think are devastating for the competitive scene.

Firstly, elo gain and loss are almost entirely based on team loss/wins with little regard for individual performance. This means that if a GE stacks with 4 silvers continuously, all of their elo will eventually converge to be roughly the same value. I play with people that are much better than me but our elo is almost the same since we play together often. Because of how little information is utilised to adjust your rank, you'd need to solo queue for many matches to get an appropriate elo, which means you end up in an unnecessarily high number of unfair matches (either rolling the enemy team or vice versa). I think Valve tried to remedy this by bootstrapping your initial rank based on individual performance, but the initial number is often way off so this doesn't work. I get the philosophy behind this design, CS is a team based game, but this system doesn't work well in practice.


Secondly is the massive overabundance of cheaters and smurfs. The weekly drop system encourages people to make/use alt accounts, causing further problems to matchmaking since you get high rank players in <10k lobbies just trying to earn their drops. Cheating also seems to be a major issue in comparison to CSGO. It seems something has happened to our trust factor, as our match quality has very sharply plummeted and we have lost 11 premier matches (yes, ) in a row, almost all of which had blatant cheaters on the enemy team. Most accounts we play against now are throwaways. Our only hope of winning is to not 5 stack and hope we get a cheater of our own on our team, but that's not fun.

The game just isn't fun anymore since we can't find matches without throwaway cheating accounts, so I plan to take a break from CS2 and just hope that the game ends up in a better state soon so that I can continue playing.",Not Recommended,2010,"1,522.9 hrs on record","Posted: June 6, 2024"

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198118435966/,"I still play the game often and I like it, but I leave a negative review because I don't like the direction it's taken. I want CS to become better, I love playing it with my friends, I like the skins, and the community has brought me many laughs, but it feels like Valve is putting the bare minimum effort to keep the game alive and have people spend money. Here's why:

-Game released bare-bones missing many maps and game modes from CSGO

-To date, every new update makes it run worse, the latest update has issues with huge frame drops, stutters, and freezing. Frame in CSGO was consistent 400, now I'm lucky to get 160fps with half decent frame times.

-Community servers are a shambling corpse of what it was in CSGO. That side of the community is dead. All the servers are full of bots. No good AWP only servers, a few good 1v1 servers, no zombies, no deathrun or the other dozens of other fun game mode servers. That whole creative side of the community has been abandoned by Valve and given little support. Surf zoomer are eating well, at least.

-Maps are pretty BUT the amount of visual clutter only lowers frames and makes it harder to see enemies.

-Ruined factory new skins by giving them all wear. Now a factory new skin looks like a minimal wear or even field tested from CSGO. Example, Bizon Osiris. (thanks for making those skins slightly cheaper, at least)

-Player models are not accurate to hit boxes, the default CT is terrible. I've flicked to parts of the model that don't count as a hit. That is a terrible decision for a competitive game.

-No more default player models that vary depending on the map. Not a big loss, but it shows a lack of attention imo.

-The HUD keeps getting worse. It's amazing how badly they can mess this up. CSGO had a minimalist, clean, and easy to read HUD with all the important info in places that have a physical reference point irl, like the health at the bottom left. New CS2 HUD has transparency on everything, selected items don't highlight as well, I really miss the nice touch of my weapons being highlighted in the color of their rarity, mini map is harder to read, my money is bigger than my health or armor, and I don't need to know what team I am by having a big emblem in the middle of my screen. The HUD is provably and quantifiably worse than in CSGO.

-Why do we have first shot inaccuracy?? Why? Makes zero sense in this type of competitive game. Why do I need to miss my one-tap headshot when my aim is on the enemy's head? Is the game really better for having that?

-Hacker issue still not fix, and the hacks have only gotten more powerful. We are talking Rainbow Six Siege levels of absurd hacks. They can change the spread of shotguns and change the the fire rate, absurd things like that.

-Ranks and elo systems are terrible and matchmaking will put you in games that will force you to lose. I'm talking about putting you against teams with 5k more elo than anyone on your team.

-Still no overwatch system like in CSGO.

-The biggest updates we got until now is a few community maps and the ability to switch hand view model... SIX months in. You know the community is starving for content when that is considered a huge update. In CSGO that would be a normal bi-monthly update.

-Hit reg is terrible and it's probably sub-tick being terrible.

-AWP nerfs were not needed and makes it frustrating to use. Inaccuracy when getting hit is terrible and taking longer for the scope to settle after aiming makes getting quick kills a game of luck at times. The AWP was fine in CSGO, maybe even perfect and satisfying to use, CS2 doesn't feel the same. I can't say it's worse, but It doesn't feel like CS anymore.

-Run and gun meta has only gotten worse.

-the tracers lie and your spray control would do better without it.

-Casual is now even worse to play because of terrible frame rate and frame timing.

-Game is trying way too hard to ""modernize"" and feel like the other zoomer competitive games like Valorant. Know what you are and own it. I don't want a cluttered HUD or an mvp animations, and please never add keychains.

+ Grenade line up reticent is an great change.
+Most skins look amazing
+maps are nice look great, even if they run terrible.
+Follow recoil is kinda cool, works wonder on the Negev.

The only good thing about this game, the better and more realistic graphics, is ruined by the the tiny mini sized guns which poop on the immersion. I don't even wanna start with the cheaters.

szu159,https://steamcommunity.com/id/szu159/,"""I really love this game. My entire gaming career is built on the Counter-Strike series, but this game has become unplayable. I’m honestly surprised that a million people still play it at the same time, because it’s just not enjoyable anymore. Basically, every second match we’re up against cheaters. And I’m not saying that just because they’re better and it frustrates me . I’m saying it because it’s obvious they’re cheating, and they’re not even trying to hide it.

After taking a break for a few years and months, I started playing again with my friends, but it turned into another short-lived encounter. VAC simply doesn’t work properly. The whole situation is just ridiculous. I have no problem with CS2 itself .
I really like the new features, but as long as there are this many cheaters, I’ll sadly have to stay away, even though, as I said, I love the game.

And I know Valve won’t be shaken by the fact that I’m writing this whole rant here, because people will keep playing regardless.",Not Recommended,826,"1,161.0 hrs on record",Posted: May 3

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199104360494/,"Counter-Strike 2: Not an Update, a Rebirth
At first glance, you think — oh, it's just CS:GO with ray tracing and protein shakes. Then you play it. And you realize: nope, this isn’t an update. It’s like your good old AK-47 suddenly developed a sense of smell.

CS2 is still that same adrenaline-fueled classic where one bullet can change the round, but now everything feels tangible. Source 2 didn’t just slap on better graphics — it poured a bucket of raw concrete into the game. You can feel things now: water droplets from explosions, the flicker of your teammate’s shadow around the corner, and smoke that doesn’t just exist — it lives.

Speaking of smoke — it’s no longer a wall. It’s a character. It moves, it breathes, it reacts to grenades like it’s got emotions. I wouldn’t be surprised if it starts streaming on Twitch next year.

The guns? Still the same arsenal, but every reload feels like you’re reloading your soul. The AWP doesn’t just boom anymore — it tears a hole in reality, pauses time, and gently lets you back into the match.

Servers finally hit 128-tick, and that’s like upgrading from smoke signals to quantum teleportation. Every movement is a dance. Every kill? Poetry. The feel is tighter, snappier, and your muscle memory comes back like a loyal dog that never really left.

It’s not perfect — hitboxes sometimes act like confused teenagers, and the UI is a bit extra. Matchmaking still throws you in with people who think the bomb site is a Spotify playlist. But that’s fine. CS2 is a foundation, not a fad. It's here to evolve.

The Verdict:
CS2 isn’t the second chapter. It’s a second life. For the aim gods and the eco warriors. For the smurfs, the noobs, the spray control philosophers. It’s not just a game — it’s the art of control, the sound of chaos, and the silence before the last shot.

But don’t worry, Valve’s totally on it. I’m sure they’re working hard on that anti cheat system. Any day now. In the meantime, enjoy getting headshot by a guy who’s both floating and twerking through the map.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198292480887/,"The suffering I’ve endured from playing Counter-Strike is a complex blend of mental, emotional, and even physical pain. It begins with the countless hours spent grinding in competitive matches, where every loss feels like a personal failure, a reflection of my inadequacies. I’ve experienced the gut-wrenching agony of getting matched with teammates who seem to have no regard for teamwork or strategy, leaving me to carry the game on my own shoulders. The weight of that responsibility crushes my spirit, especially when I still lose despite my best efforts. Every missed shot feels like a betrayal of my own hands, a reminder that no matter how many hours I pour into improving my aim or game sense, there are still moments where I am utterly powerless. The suffocating tension of a 1v1 clutch situation is something I’ve felt in my bones, the pressure building as the seconds tick away, my palms sweating, heart racing, only to die to some sniper crouching in a corner, completely erasing any hope of victory.

The toxicity of the community adds another layer to the pain. It’s not just the personal failures; it’s the verbal abuse that follows. No matter how well I play, there’s always that one teammate who’s quick to hurl insults, to tear down whatever little confidence I’ve built. The constant barrage of blame, the accusations that I’m throwing the game or that I’m a noob, gnaws away at my self-esteem. Every match feels like a battlefield, not just against the enemy team but against my own squad, fighting to maintain my mental stability while being bombarded by insults, racial slurs, and unnecessary aggression. Then there’s the pain of seeing a perfectly executed strategy fall apart due to one small mistake, whether it's a missed flashbang or an ill-timed push. The frustration builds with every game, the crushing realization that even though I’ve spent hundreds, maybe thousands, of hours in the game, I’m still not where I want to be skill-wise.

Physically, the game has taken its toll as well. My back and wrists ache from sitting in the same position for hours, hunched over, eyes glued to the screen, fingers moving in a precise, rapid-fire rhythm. The late nights have robbed me of sleep, leaving me exhausted, but I can’t stop playing because I’m chasing that one good game, that fleeting moment of victory that keeps me coming back, even though deep down I know that satisfaction will never outweigh the frustration. Counter-Strike has become a cycle of suffering, where each win is quickly overshadowed by a string of losses, and every moment of joy is drowned out by the ever-present, gnawing feeling of defeat.

1nsekt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/1nsekt/,"I’ve been playing CS for over 20 years. From 1.5 to 1.6, Source, GO... Cheaters were always around, but they were a fringe, shamed by the community, usually hiding in the shadows. After CS2 launched? It’s an absolute disaster. Cheaters don’t even try to hide anymore, running around with Scouts, landing headshots across the map like it’s a joke.

It perfectly reflects Gen Z's mindset, convinced they're the best at everything, yet can't handle losing without cheating to validate their delusions.

So here’s a reality check, boys:
Being proud of winning in CS2 while using cheats is like feeling satisfied that your wife had an orgasm, but only because another man gave it to her while you watched from the corner. Technically, you were there… but you weren’t really part of the achievement.

And VAC? If this whole thing were a metaphor, VAC would be Gaben in the corner, filming everything on a dusty VHS camcorder, silently watching while doing absolutely nothing.

Pros:
- I've spent tens of thousands of hours in this game over the years - and it gave me countless moments of pure joy, adrenaline, and unforgettable memories.
- The game sharpens your strategic thinking and decision-making speed like nothing else. It’s not just about aiming, it’s about reading the game, adapting, and outsmarting your opponent.

Cons:
- Kids today don’t understand that to be good at something, you need to put in real effort.
- Taking the easy way out (cheating) ruins the experience for everyone else.
- What CS2 has become: a playground for aimbotting, wallhacking clowns with zero shame is a disgrace to everything this game used to stand for.",Recommended,1375,"6,961.3 hrs on record",Posted: March 29

Floding,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Floding/,"when cheaters aren't a factor, this game is the exemplary competitive FPS. Movement and shooting mechanics are stable, functional, and above all responsive, whilst providing a limitless skill ceiling that ensures that CS2 is an excellent outlet for improving your skills and progressing towards mastery.

The meta and mechanics remaining as stable as they do is a rare sight for the genre but is perhaps the most major contributor to why counter-strike is such a rewarding outlet for moment to moment gameplay, improvement, and mastery. (when approached with a healthy mindset, which can be difficult or impossible for some to maintain)

For me personally, who is at an intermediate level of skill; The shooting mechanics of CS2 manage to be an engaging, satisfying, and at times extremely difficult system and yet never feeling like an unfair, or insurmountable, obstacle. The movement mechanics have surprising depth without intimidating or overly punishing new or intermediate players busy grappling with the shooting mechanics. Maps and especially utility is where the game makes available the full extent of potential skill growth through theory and knowledge. Where the other aspects of the game are largely tried to the mechanical ability of the player, maps and utility largely reverses this and is the main factor which makes or breaks performances at higher levels of play.

Counter-Strike can be a frustrating mix of reliance on teammates and reliance on yourself, the game ensures that your performance has an impact and in order to win games against opponents of similar skill you must be able to lean on teamwork. This means for many, the game can be tilting through the failings of the self or your teammates, but if you are able to develop an environment where you're able to lean on your team and develop your skills in conjunction with them, then you will more often than not reap the rewards of satisfaction and hard earned achievement that counter-strike has to offer.",Recommended,1667,317.8 hrs on record,"Posted: May 29, 2024"
SorasakiShiina,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SorasakiShiina/,"This review is written in three languages: Chinese, Vietnamese, and English.
此 评测 使用三种语言编写：中文、越南语和英语。
Bài review này được viết bằng ba ngôn ngữ: Trung, Việt, Anh

Note: I'm actually ""praising"" this game, so please don't ask me to downvote it! 🐧
English:
I spent 200 hours on this damn game only to realize that cheaters in this game are more common than on Tinder, OkCupid, or any other dating app!

Primer: You think you can brag about your skills on the global leaderboard? Nope, it's the ""Chinese/Russian wizard power ranking"" with countless magical abilities like ""ninja tornado go (also known as helicopter),"" ""sharingan (wall),"" magic bullet,...

Language Learning: Want to learn Russian or Chinese without paying for expensive courses? Don't worry, in CS we have a team of professional instructors ranging from 13-99+ years old with years of experience equal to their CS playtime, who will guide you (even your mom) with colorful, profound, poetic words that encourage you to quit the match.

Gambling: Even a blind person knows this game is a gambling simulator. You open cases with dreams of getting rich, buying a mansion and a car, but in reality, you can't even get a rubber band. In this game, you'll also see what inflation is like when a knife in CS is more expensive than the one you're using in your kitchen. Thanks to Valve for creating an ""inflation"" environment for everyone to imagine instead of setting foot in Venezuela.

Updates: Valve cares a lot about players by providing them with things they didn't ask for (or even want) like Ragdoll, gun show-off actions,... Moreover, Valve is very generous in updating (remaking) the entire game except for its Anti Cheat :)). Of course, Valve will ""love"" players even more, so you don't need to worry.

Do I recommend this game? Well, if you like learning insults in Russian and Chinese, losing virtual money, and being beaten by free hacks on Google, then why not! If not, then it seems games like Dark Souls are more suitable for you.

10/10 would uninstall again!

Chinese ver:
我花了 200 个小时在这该死的游戏上，结果才意识到，这个游戏里的作弊者比 Tinder、OkCupid 或任何其他约会应用上还多！

简介：
你以为你可以在全球排行榜上炫耀你的技能吗？不，那只是“中俄巫师力量排名”，里面有无数魔法技能，比如“忍者龙卷风去（也叫直升机）”，“写轮眼（墙）”，“魔法子弹”……

语言学习：
想学俄语或中文但不想花钱上贵的课程？别担心，在 CS 里，我们有一个由年龄在 13 到 99 岁以上的专业教练团队组成，他们的经验与他们在 CS 上的游戏时间相当，他们会用五彩斑斓、深刻而富有诗意的话语来引导你（甚至是你的妈妈），鼓励你退出比赛。

赌博：
即使是盲人也知道这游戏是一个赌博模拟器。你开箱子时怀着发财、买豪宅和车的梦想，但实际上你甚至连一个橡皮筋都拿不到。在这个游戏里，你还会看到什么叫做通货膨胀，当 CS 里的刀比你厨房里的刀还贵时。感谢 Valve 为大家创造了一个“通货膨胀”的环境，让大家可以想象，而不是踏上委内瑞拉的土地。

更新：
Valve 非常关心玩家，提供了他们并没有要求（甚至不想要）的东西，比如 ragdoll（布娃娃效果）、炫枪动作……此外，Valve 在更新（重制）整个游戏方面非常慷慨，除了它的反作弊系统 :))。当然，Valve 会更加“爱”玩家，所以你无需担心。

我推荐这个游戏吗？
嗯，如果你喜欢学俄语和中文的侮辱性语言、输虚拟货币、以及被 Google 上的免费作弊工具打败，那为什么不呢！如果不是，那么像《黑暗之魂》这样的游戏可能更适合你。

10/10，会再次卸载。!


Vietnamese ver:
Tôi đã bỏ ra 200 tiếng trong con game chết tiệt này để nhận ra rằng cheater trong game này còn phổ biến hơn cả Tinders, Litmatch, hay tất cả app hẹn hò nào khác!

Primer: Bạn nghĩ rằng bạn sẽ có quyền khoe khoang kỹ năng của mình trên bảng xếp hạng toàn cầu ư?. Đéo, đó là ""Bảng xếp hạng chiến lực của các pháp sư trung hoa và nga ngố"" với vô vàn phép thần thông như ""lốc xoáy ninja go (còn được biết đến với helicopter)"", ""sharingan (wall)"", magic bullet,...

Ngoại ngữ: Bạn muốn học tiếng nga, tiếng trung mà không phải bỏ tiền cho các khoá học xa xỉ?. Đừng lo, ở CS chúng tôi có đội ngũ giảng viên chuyên nghiệp trải dài từ 13-99+ tuổi với số năm kinh nghiệm bằng số giờ chơi CS sẽ chỉ dẫn tận tình cho bạn (thậm chí là mẹ bạn) nhưng từ ngữ đầy màu sắc, thâm thuý, văn thơ khuyến khích bạn từ bỏ trận đấu.

Đánh bạc: Người bị mù cũng biết game này là giả lập đánh bạc. Bạn mở hòm với ước mơ đổi đời, mua được cho mình nhà lầu xe hơi nhưng thực tế bạn đến cái dây thun buộc tiên cũng không lấy được. Trong game này thì bạn cũng sẽ thấy lạm pháp là như thế nào khi mà một con dao trong CS còn đắt hơn con dao bạn đang dùng trong nhà bếp của mình. Cảm ơn Valve đã tạo ra được một môi trường ""lạm pháp"" để mọi người có thể hình dung thay vì đặt chân đến Venezuel.

Cập nhật: Valve rất quan tâm đến người chơi khi mà cung cấp cho họ thứ mà họ chưa yêu cầu (thậm chí là đéo muốn) như Ragdoll, Hành động khoe súng,... Đã thế, Valve lại rất rộng lượng khi cập nhất (làm lại) cả một game trừ Anti Cheat của nó :)). Tất nhiên Valve sẽ còn ""yêu quý"" người chơi hơn nữa nên các bạn không cần lo.

Tôi có khuyên kích con game này không? Chà, nếu mà bạn thích học các lời xúc phạm bằng tiếng nga, tiếng trung, mất tiền ảo, và bị đánh bại bởi hack free trên Google, vậy thì có tại sao không chứ! Nếu đéo, thì có vẻ mấy con game như Dark Soul mới hợp với bạn.

During the game, you will often have the urge to whip someone with an electric cable, but you will quickly get used to it. At the beginning of the game, you spawn with 4 other people, two of whom don't have a microphone and you wish the other two didn't have one. Most of them do not even speak English and they shout various spells at the others.

xeosFIN,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xeosFIN/,"Counter-Strike 2 is the long-awaited upgrade to one of the most iconic FPS games in history. Built on the Source 2 engine, it brings improved graphics, enhanced responsiveness, and a reworked smoke grenade system that adds more tactical depth. But does it truly feel like a step forward?

Pros:
✅ Visual & Performance Upgrade: The move to Source 2 provides crisper visuals, better lighting, and improved physics, making the game feel more modern while retaining its classic style.
✅ Responsive Gameplay: CS2 maintains the tight, skill-based mechanics that make Counter-Strike a masterpiece in competitive shooters.
✅ New Smoke Mechanics: Dynamic smoke grenades that interact with bullets and explosions add fresh strategic possibilities.
✅ Free Upgrade for CS:GO Players: If you owned CS:GO, you get CS2 for free—so there's no risk in trying it out.

Cons:
❌ Missing Features: Some beloved features from CS:GO (like certain maps, modes, and community servers) are still absent.
❌ Hit Reg & Subtick System Issues: While the new subtick update system aims to improve responsiveness, some players have reported inconsistencies in hit registration.
❌❌ Balancing & Anti-Cheat: Cheating remains an issue, and certain weapon balances could still use fine-tuning.
❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌❌
FINAL !!!!
Counter-Strike 2 is a solid evolution rather than a revolution. It brings necessary updates to a legendary game but still feels like a work in progress. If you're a long-time fan, it's worth playing, but if you're expecting a groundbreaking experience, you might be slightly disappointed. That said, with continued updates and community feedback, CS2 has the potential to become just as beloved as its predecessor.

Okay, I have over 1,000 hours in CS:GO. And somehow, despite all the blood, sweat, and keyboard rage I’ve poured into this game, I’m still here—writing a review about how much I absolutely despise it. But… I love it. I really do. CS:GO is like the toxic ex you can’t quit—every time you swear it off, it pulls you back in with a clutch play or a smooth headshot that makes you think, “Maybe I’m actually good at this.” Spoiler: I’m not.
The community? Oh, it’s a beautiful dumpster fire. It's like walking into a room full of people who think they’re the next esports prodigy while you’re just over here trying to figure out how to properly throw a flashbang without blinding yourself. It’s a chaotic mess where everyone is a god, and I am the unfortunate 13-year-old with a voice crack trying to explain why I didn’t buy armor because I just had enough money for a deagle. “BUY A DEFUSER!” they yell, even though I was the one who defused the bomb last round, you ungrateful pixel warrior.
The language in this game? Oh boy. It's like a master class in toxic masculinity and insecurity. I’ve never heard so many grown men act like their whole identity hinges on being the best at a 10-year-old game. It’s always the same—guys who are so insecure about their skill who’ve convinced themselves that yelling at random strangers online will somehow make them feel better about their lives.
Somehow, I keep coming back. I guess I’m addicted to the pain. The matchmaking system? More like ""matchmaking mystery."" Every time I join a game, I’m greeted by a mix of 12-year-olds who think they’re in Call of Duty and people who are just aggressively shouting in their mics. ""I’m a pro"" says one guy with a 1-8 K/D. Alright, buddy, sure.
You know what though? I love it. There’s something about CS:GO that keeps me coming back. Sure, I’ve had my heart broken by the game more times than I can count (many, many, many opened cases with nothing but blue skins of despair), but every time I hear the sweet sound of the bomb ticking down, or the satisfying clink of a headshot, I remember why I keep playing.
Would I recommend this game to anyone? Well, yes, but only if you’re ready to experience frustration, confusion, and an unhealthy dependency on substances. CS:GO is like that abusive relationship that always promises it’ll get better, but deep down, we all know the truth: it won’t.

But hey, I’ll still be playing tomorrow.

1/10, but like, a 10/10 for masochism.

Rating: 4.5/5 Face-Palms


I just spent the last 5 hours of my life playing CS2, and I'm still trying to figure out why I voluntarily subjected myself to this never-ending cycle of frustration and disappointment. It's like Valve took all the worst parts of online gaming, put them in a blender, and hit puree.

The gameplay is still solid, I'll give them that. It's like riding a bike – except the bike is on fire, and the road is made of broken dreams and shattered hopes. You'll still get that rush of adrenaline when you clutch up and win a round, but it's quickly replaced by the crushing despair of realizing you're still stuck in a lobby with a team of bots who think ""strategy"" is a fancy word for ""run around like a headless chicken and hope for the best.""

The graphics are nice, I guess. I mean, who doesn't love watching their opponents' avatars do the ""I just got killed by a 12-year-old with a sensitivity of 400"" dance? It's like Valve hired a team of expert animators to craft the perfect ""I'm about to rage-quit"" facial expressions.

And don't even get me started on the community. I'm pretty sure the only thing more toxic than the game's chat is the water in a Chernobyl cooling tower. It's like everyone's competing in some sort of twisted, masochistic game of ""Who Can Be the Most Creative with Their Insults."" I've seen more civil discourse at a Kanye West concert.

But hey, at least the sound design is on point. I mean, who doesn't love the soothing sound of their own screams of frustration echoing through their headphones at 3 AM?

In conclusion, CS2 is a game that will simultaneously make you want to pull your hair out and scream ""ONE MORE ROUND!"" until the wee hours of the morning. It's like a bad relationship – you know it's not good for you, but you just can't help yourself.

Pros:

Still a great game, I guess
Will make you question your life choices
Excellent training for developing a thick skin and a strong sense of humor

Cons:

Will make you want to throw your computer out the window
May cause spontaneous combustion due to excessive rage
Not recommended for people with high blood pressure or a weak heart

xylinx,https://steamcommunity.com/id/xylinx/,"A Great Game Stifled by Cheaters and Underwhelming Updates

Counter-Strike 2 offers thrilling FPS action with tight gunplay and competitive gameplay, but cheaters have become a major issue, ruining the experience for honest players. The game’s anti-cheat system struggles to keep up, leading to frustrating encounters with aimbots and wallhackers. This undermines the integrity of the competitive scene and drives many players away.

The recent Armory update, meant to breathe new life into the game, falls flat. Instead of delivering meaningful content, it feels like a shallow cash grab with overpriced skins and little to no impactful gameplay changes. The updates increasingly prioritize monetization over player experience, making it harder for dedicated fans to stay invested in a game that’s losing its charm. The game's potential is still there, but the cheater problem and disappointing updates are slowly ruining it.",Recommended,789,359.6 hrs on record,"Posted: November 23, 2024"

asitttttt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/asitttttt/,"🇬🇧 English:
My journey with Counter-Strike began back in the days of version 1.5. I fell in love with the pure competitive spirit hidden within those simple pixels. Every round, every clutch moment, every aim duel stirred a unique excitement inside me. CS wasn’t just a game to me—it was a passion, a love, a way of life. I spent days grinding, nights without sleep, dreaming of becoming a pro. I wanted to wear a team jersey, compete in tournaments, and hear my name echo in the arena. But talent alone wasn’t enough, and the circumstances at the time didn’t work in my favor. Still, the fire in me never faded.

As the years passed, versions evolved—CS 1.6, Source, Global Offensive—and I followed them all. I was always there, part of it. But eventually, the unfairness within the game—especially the cheaters—began to drain my love for it. Every match started to feel pointless. ""Was there a cheater again?"" became my routine question.

At some point, I gave in. I betrayed the purity of my passion. I told myself, “If everyone else is doing it, why not me?” I deeply regret it to this day. I ended up getting my most valuable accounts—full of years of effort and memories—banned. The shame of those actions still lingers within me like a scar.

But even through all that, I never stopped loving CS. Because CS was a reflection of me. The sounds of gunfire, the ticking bombs, the mid-round calls—they became the soundtrack of my youth. The discipline, reaction speed, and mental strength I developed thanks to CS helped me far beyond the screen.

Now, CS2 is here. With a brand-new engine, more realistic physics, advanced lighting and shadows—it offers a fresh, immersive experience. But to be honest, it still needs work. Optimization issues, matchmaking problems, and bugs still affect gameplay. However, that doesn't mean it can’t improve. CS has always been a game that evolves and matures over time.

Counter-Strike is my childhood love. My first passion. My first real thrill. And that kind of love never dies. It only transforms. CS will live on forever—because it lives in us. In the players who gave their hearts to it.

CS never dies. It simply gets reborn.

🇹🇷 Türkçe:
Counter-Strike serüvenim 1.5 sürümüyle başladı. O basit piksellerin içinde saklı o saf rekabet ruhuna âşık oldum. Her round, her clutch anı, her aim kapışması içimde ayrı bir heyecan yaratıyordu. CS benim için sadece bir oyun değildi—bir tutkuydu, bir aşktı, bir yaşam biçimiydi. Günlerce oynadım, gecelerce uykusuz kaldım. Profesyonel olmak istedim. Takım forması giymek, turnuvalara katılmak, ismimi arenada duymak... Ama yetenek tek başına yetmedi, o zamanki şartlar da buna izin vermedi. Yine de içimdeki o kıvılcım hiç sönmedi.

Yıllar geçtikçe sürümler değişti—CS 1.6, Source, Global Offensive—ve ben hepsini takip ettim. Hep içindeydim, bir parçasıydım. Ama zamanla, özellikle hileciler yüzünden oyundaki adaletsizlik sevgimi tüketmeye başladı. Her maçın ardından aklımda tek bir cümle dönüp duruyordu: “Yine hile mi vardı?”

Bir noktada ben de yenik düştüm. O tertemiz tutkumu kirlettim. “Herkes yapıyor, ben de deneyeyim” dedim. Bugün hâlâ pişmanım. Yıllarca emek verdiğim, anılar biriktirdiğim en değerli hesaplarım ban yedi. O anların utancı hâlâ içimde bir yara gibi duruyor.

Ama tüm bunlara rağmen CS’yi sevmekten asla vazgeçmedim. Çünkü CS, bana ayna tutuyordu. Silah sesleri, bombaların tıkırtısı, round ortasında gelen takım çağrıları—gençliğimin fon müziği oldu. CS sayesinde geliştirdiğim refleks, disiplin ve mental direnç ekranın ötesine geçti; hayatta da bana yol gösterdi.

Ve şimdi CS2 geldi. Yepyeni bir oyun motoru, daha gerçekçi fizik kuralları, gelişmiş ışık ve gölge efektleriyle taze ve derin bir deneyim sunuyor. Ama dürüst olmak gerekirse hâlâ eksikleri var. Optimizasyon sıkıntıları, eşleştirme sorunları ve bazı hatalar oyun keyfini baltalıyor. Ancak bu gelişmeyeceği anlamına gelmiyor. CS her zaman zamanla gelişen ve olgunlaşan bir oyun oldu.

Counter-Strike benim çocukluk aşkım. İlk tutkum. İlk gerçek heyecanım. Ve böyle bir aşk asla ölmez. Sadece şekil değiştirir. CS sonsuza dek yaşayacak—çünkü onu yaşatan bizleriz. Ona kalbini vermiş oyuncular.

CS asla ölmez. Sadece yeniden doğar.",Recommended,3566,629.2 hrs on record,Posted: April 8

I would like to suggest a small but useful improvement to the match acceptance process in CS2. Currently, players can accept a match by simply clicking the ""Accept"" button with the mouse. However, in Dota 2, you can accept a match by pressing the Enter key, which makes the process faster and more convenient. I believe that adding the same functionality to CS2 - allowing players to accept a match using the Enter key - would improve the user experience. This small change can improve accessibility and make it easier for many players to find partners. Thank you for considering this suggestion, and I appreciate all your work on CS2!

3. You can't build a base and collect resources;

5. Interaction with non-player characters to get quests is not provided;
6. Primitive parkour system;
7. Open world? There is no such thing here;
8. The intelligence of bots that play with you in competitive matches leaves much to be desired;
9. Poor arsenal of melee weapons;
10. No PvE and zombie mode;
11. No character pumping (maybe I'm wrong and just haven't found which button opens the menu of improvements, as there are enemies who have open the ability to see through walls and pumped marksmanship at 1000%).",Recommended,710,"3,046.0 hrs on record","Posted: December 22, 2024"

notreallythere,https://steamcommunity.com/id/notreallythere/,"CS2 is CS without the little CS happiness that we used to collect.
You can't surf. Cyberathlete Amateur League is long gone, along with IRC, our parapet, our barrier to community. Hop into a CS match today, and you can't hop. Because your bunnies are dead. But you get used to the decay. The only thing a human being cannot get used to is stubbing a toe on the bed frame.

Picture this: it's Spring of 2008. Friday. 3:14pm. You just got home from school. On the way home, Mom knows you're hungry and stopped for you to pick up a personal pepperoni pan pizza from Pizza Hut drive thru. No homework this weekend (well, a little algebra perhaps. but you're gonna copy that off the mild mannered stinky kid come Monday morning before first period).

You quickly slam that delicious little pizza down your gullet while watching a rerun of the Mythbusters exploding water heater episode. But you're hardly paying attention to the TV, since you've seen that episode before.
The pizza is slightly oversauced, so as you grab a piece, you squeeze the crust a lil and smear a bit of the sauce off the edge of the slice and onto the thin cardboard box. You see the pizza box has a checkmark under Pepperoni. You know it is right- the worker checked it off with Sharpie. You have achieved a perfect balance in your bite.

But soon the pizza is gone, and you are faced with the most difficult of choices... Do I wack one back or do I load up mIRC, send some messages in #sourceringer first? Maybe i'll get picked up to scrim. Maybe they won't have sv_cheats tucked into their lo3 script (Gosh i sure do hope i make cal-im next season)

Fast forward: Now it is 2025, and whatever happened to those markers that smell like fruits? The scholastic book fair had plenty for sale. Where are they now? Where am I now? The weight of existence smothers you some more.

And suddenly you remember-- no one ever prank calls each other anymore... And winning in CS doesn't feel quite the same",Recommended,1614,"4,626.4 hrs on record",Posted: April 2

The graphics are crisp and clean, making every headshot feel more satisfying, and the gunplay is perfection, with weapons feeling more balanced and deadly than before. The revamped maps bring a nice blend of familiarity with a few surprises, keeping even the veterans on their toes.

But let’s be real—it’s still got that brutal learning curve, so if you’re not bringing your A-game, prepare for some serious ego bruising. And sure, with the new engine comes a few bugs and hiccups, but nothing that ruins the fun. Some die-hard fans might miss the gritty charm of the old CS, but for most, CS2 is the perfect blend of old-school intensity with a modern twist.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198967888189/,"Counter-Strike has a huge place in my heart and a lot of childhood memories. Now, of course, I mean CS 1.6, which I have been playing since I was eight years old, on my old account I had played some 4-5 thousand hours (and only since I had steam) and that was exactly the reason why I started a new steam account years ago, to stop being addicted to Counter-Strike.
Clans, Leagues, Servers, Mods, Classic, Knife, Jailbreak, Soccerjam, Jump, Deathrun, Deathrace, Surf, Zombie.

For a while I played Soccerjam all day long, also for the league (sjpro.com), then there was a period where I played Jailbreak for hundreds of hours, maybe thousands.
So much wasted time on one game. Just one game all day long, for years.
And I don't regret it at all, I would do it all over again. I loved that game.

This all belonged to Counter-Strike 1.6... I will only write about the reviews of Counter-Strike 2 that it doesn't catch on to its predecessor at all, boring more realistic graphics is all the game can offer.
Today, the player no longer has any freedom in creating modes, maps, commands and anything else, everything is governed by rules and gets boring after a while.
I go to the server where I have admin rights, I type in the console the command sv_gravity 300, mp_airaccelerate 100, developer 1 and I can fly around the map, today such things are not possible.

Solaeyn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Solaeyn/,"I've played seventeen hours of CS2, and I am pretty sure that I have seen every kind of torture imaginable, both emotional and physical. This game doesn't test your aim but is a test of your sanity.

Every death feels like a wake-up call for me. You almost see every useless hour you've spent with it, only to be taken down by one headshot every time. It's like the game says to you, ""You're just not good enough."" Well, that's not even the worst part. Every single concept I ever came across about winning, about knowing combat, was ruined. I fail at every turn to understand what victory truly is and what it requires.

And the physical? Don't even get me started on that. I am a human pretzel at this point, my shoulders locked from tension, my arms molded to the shape of my mouse, and my neck might as well have relocated to Tension Town. I come out of each session like I've survived a bar fight I was destined to lose.

And then there is the mind game. Every game is just a spiral of self-doubt and second-guessing; I'll spot an enemy, hesitate half a second, and it's boom-I'm back in the lobby, replaying that moment in my head. Each misplayed call, missed shot, and poorly chosen utility feeds into an unrelenting inner monologue asking, why do I keep coming back?

andidumi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/andidumi/,"As a long-time Counter-Strike player, I was excited to dive into Counter-Strike 2 and see how it builds on the foundation of CS:GO. After spending considerable time with the game, I can confidently say that CS2 delivers a solid evolution for the franchise.

The Positives:
- Stunning Graphics: The upgrade to the Source 2 engine has done wonders for the game's visual appeal. Maps like Dust2 and Mirage have been beautifully reimagined, with enhanced textures and dynamic lighting that make them feel fresh yet familiar. The game’s visual fidelity truly stands out, especially when compared to its predecessor.

- Smooth Performance: Despite the graphical improvements, the game runs surprisingly well on my setup. I haven’t experienced any significant performance drops, and the frame rates remain consistent even during intense firefights. Valve seems to have done a good job optimizing the game for a wide range of hardware.

- Refined Gameplay: CS2 retains the tight, competitive gameplay that the series is known for, while making subtle tweaks that improve the overall experience. The new mechanics fit seamlessly into the established framework, making the game feel fresh without straying too far from what fans love.

Few Minor Drawbacks:
- Occasional Bugs: While the game has been relatively stable, I did encounter a few minor bugs here and there, nothing game-breaking but noticeable. I’m confident these will be patched out quickly, as Valve continues to fine-tune the game post-launch.

- Learning Curve: For new players or those returning after a long break, the learning curve can be steep. CS2 inherits the same high skill ceiling that makes Counter-Strike so rewarding, but also potentially daunting for newcomers.

Conclusion:
Overall, Counter-Strike 2 is a worthy successor to CS:GO, successfully updating the series for a new generation without losing the essence of what makes it great. The game looks and plays better than ever, and while there are a few minor bugs, they don’t detract from the overall experience. Whether you're a veteran of the series or a newcomer, CS2 is definitely worth your time.",Recommended,1796,701.0 hrs on record,"Posted: August 13, 2024"

CombatMedick,https://steamcommunity.com/id/CombatMedick/,"Counter-Strike 2 – Not Bad. But the DLC, Operations, Anti-Cheat, No More Predatory Gambling, and the New DLC Gamemodes?? Actually Fantastic.

Okay, so I think I might be one of the few who’s actually enjoying this more than Global Offensive. Maybe it’s because of the new engine, maybe it’s because of the DLC & Operations, or maybe just because CS2 finally feels fresh. But let’s be real—the DLC is what really makes this game stand out. The DLC maps? Easily some of the best added in years, making every match feel less repetitive. The DLC skins? Gorgeous. And the DLC gamemodes? This is what really sets CS2 apart from CS:GO—there’s finally variety.

Gunplay is still as solid as ever, but the DLC weapons add just enough variety without breaking balance. And the DLC character models? They actually look great this time—no more weird CS:GO agent skins that didn’t fit the style. The DLC animations? A massive improvement—everything feels smoother, more polished. Even the DLC-exclusive cosmetics feel like they actually put effort into them instead of just throwing in random skins.

BUT THE ANTI-CHEAT, THOUGH. Finally, Valve did something. VAC Live actually bans cheaters mid-match, which is both hilarious and a game-changer. No more wasting 30 minutes only to get destroyed by a spinbotter. And the DLC anti-cheat updates? Matchmaking actually feels fair now. They even cancel the match if a cheater is caught, so you don’t lose your rank. Honestly, this alone makes CS2 ten times better than CS:GO ever was. Plus, the DLC operations introduce more ways to play that don’t just feel like a grind.

And FINALLY, something I’ve been asking for for YEARS: they got rid of the predatory gambling mechanics. And the best part? The DLC content doesn’t rely on loot boxes. No more random gambling disguised as fun. The game is actually about skill and gameplay now, not just a casino wrapped in an FPS. The DLC packs actually give you what you pay for, instead of making you roll the dice. This is a huge win, and it’s about time Valve actually listened to me.

And the best part? The DLC added so many new gamemodes. Classic competitive is still the main focus, but now we’ve got real variety. The DLC 2D RPG mode? Perfect if you want a break from ranked. The DLC tactical ops mode? A cool twist on the usual bomb defusal. And my personal favorite, the DLC co-op missions—actually fun, well-designed, and worth playing. Instead of just running the same matches over and over, the DLC gamemodes finally make CS2 feel complete.

Matchmaking still has some issues, but at least the DLC Operation playlists give us new ways to play. Also, the DLC casual mode actually feels structured instead of just a warm-up for ranked. DLC Operation missions are way more interesting, not just boring “plant the bomb 67 times” challenges. The DLC content in general just adds so much more to do.

Overall, it’s still Counter-Strike at its core, but the DLC, Operations, Anti-Cheat improvements, the removal of predatory loot boxes, and the incredible variety of new gamemodes make it feel better than ever. If you didn’t like CS:GO before, this probably won’t change your mind—but for me? The DLC alone makes it worth playing!",Recommended,2673,"2,748.5 hrs on record",Posted: March 19

Title: Counter-Strike 2

Summary: Multiplayer shooter

Personal notes: The classic team arena shooter. The skin market is crazy in this game, I personally have never ventured deep into this market but I know its a big draw for some. Have had some great memories made with teammates and friends alike. It's pretty fun to play with friends even if most people still playing are sweaty. Only one achievement for opening so there's that. If you have never heard of CS in general I would have a hard time believing you, but if you somehow haven't, I would give it a shot. Not only is it free but it's one of the best free games out there. Only reason I don't rate it higher is because they forced people over to CS-2 and took away the original achievements, which is quite frustrating.

Counter-Strike 2 (CS2), the latest iteration of the iconic Counter-Strike franchise, has successfully captured the essence of its predecessors while infusing modern innovations that elevate the series to new heights. As one of the most beloved first-person shooters in gaming history, CS2 retains the core mechanics that fans adore while offering a fresh experience that sets it apart.

Visual Overhaul
One of the most striking features of CS2 is its visual upgrade. Leveraging the latest advancements in the Source 2 engine, the game presents stunningly realistic environments, enhanced lighting, and detailed textures that breathe new life into classic maps. Whether it’s the sun-drenched lanes of Dust II or the night-enshrouded corridors of Nuke, the attention to graphical fidelity enhances immersion without compromising the gameplay flow.

Refined Gameplay Mechanics
CS2 maintains the series' trademark blend of strategic depth and fast-paced action. The gunplay is as tight and responsive as ever, rewarding skill and precision. The introduction of dynamic smoke grenades that react to the environment and player actions adds a new layer of tactical depth, making each round feel distinct. Furthermore, the refined movement system strikes a balance between realism and fluidity, catering to both casual players and competitive enthusiasts.

Community and Competitive Scene
Valve has placed significant emphasis on community engagement and the competitive scene. The revamped matchmaking system, anti-cheat improvements, and an expanded suite of tools for custom games and mods ensure a robust ecosystem for players of all skill levels. CS2’s integration with esports platforms, comprehensive stat tracking, and frequent updates reflect a commitment to fostering a thriving competitive community.

Sound Design
Sound design in CS2 has also received notable attention. The positional audio is more accurate and nuanced, allowing players to better discern enemy locations and actions. The updated weapon sounds and ambient noise contribute to an immersive auditory experience, making every firefight feel impactful.

Overall Impression
Counter-Strike 2 stands as a testament to the enduring appeal of the series, blending nostalgia with innovation. Its graphical enhancements, refined mechanics, and robust community features make it a standout title in the FPS genre. Whether you're a veteran of the franchise or a newcomer, CS2 offers a compelling, dynamic, and endlessly replayable experience.

In summary, CS2 not only honors its legacy but also paves the way for the future of competitive shooters.

howlux,https://steamcommunity.com/id/howlux/,"Pros:

1. Improved Graphics: The Source 2 engine elevates the visuals significantly. Maps feel more alive with better lighting, textures, and environmental details, while still maintaining the clean design essential for competitive gameplay.

2. Responsive Gunplay: The core mechanics feel as sharp as ever, with weapon handling and recoil delivering that signature CS experience. It’s satisfying and skill-intensive, rewarding precision and practice.

3. Dynamic Smoke Grenades: The new volumetric smokes are a game-changer. They react to gunfire, grenades, and the environment, adding new layers of strategy to every round.

4. Enhanced Matchmaking: A better ranking system and reduced wait times make finding matches easier and more enjoyable.

5. Free Upgrade for CS:GO Players: Valve offers Counter-Strike 2 as a free upgrade for CS:GO owners, ensuring the player base transitions smoothly.


Cons:

1. Optimization Issues: While the visuals are stunning, some players report performance drops even on high-end hardware. Optimization needs further tweaking.

2. Lack of New Content: At launch, the game primarily updates existing CS:GO maps and mechanics rather than introducing substantial new content, leaving some players wanting more.

3. Cheating Concerns: Despite Valve’s anti-cheat improvements, the game still faces issues with hackers, particularly in casual and lower-ranked matches.

4. Steep Learning Curve: As with its predecessors, Counter-Strike 2 is not beginner-friendly. New players might struggle with the mechanics and the unforgiving nature of competitive play.

5. Community Issues: Toxicity remains a significant problem, especially in public lobbies and lower-ranked matches.",Recommended,1475,"2,299.3 hrs on record","Posted: November 23, 2024"

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199511574751/,"So, Counter-Strike 2—what a game, right? If you’ve ever wondered why you haven’t tossed your PC out the window and jumped off a bridge after that, well, this is the game that’ll make you want to.

Who even needs to be good at games anymore when you’ve got hacks? CS2 is like a playground for cheaters. The anti-cheat system is so useless, it’s almost like they’re in on it. You’ll be trying to play, and then bam!—some dude’s headshotting you through walls like they’ve got X-ray vision or something. And the anti-cheat? Yeah, it does absolutely nothing. It’s like having a security guard that’s permanently on a lunch break—it’s just there for show. You can basically do whatever you want—smurf, grief, hack—you name it, and you’ll never get banned. The game’s more like a free-for-all where anything goes and nobody cares.

The CS2 community is where you meet the best of humanity. And by best, I mean the absolute worst. From the second you join, you’re hit with a wave of insults and slurs that make you wonder why you even bothered. The advice they give is super helpful—like detailed steps on how to uninstall the game and kill yourself. It’s great to know people care enough to tell you to get lost forever. Real heartwarming stuff, right?

But wait, there’s more! If you’re actually good at the game, you’ll get vote-kicked because everyone thinks you’re cheating. If you’re bad, well, you’ll get vote-kicked because, duh, you suck. It’s a no-win situation that just adds to the fun. One of the most popular phrases you’ll hear is “clutch or kick, b**ch,” even if you’re the top fragger. Because nothing says team spirit like kicking the best player for not pulling off impossible plays every round.

Who needs to be a decent person when you can play a game that’s basically a racism simulator? CS2 is the place to go if you want to hear the worst things people can say to each other. Whether it’s casual slurs or full-on racist rants, the voice chat is like an all-access pass to the worst parts of the internet. It’s almost like the game was designed to show off just how awful people can be.

If you’ve never questioned why you exist, don’t worry—CS2’s got you covered. After just a few rounds of getting destroyed by hackers and getting yelled at by your teammates, you’ll start to wonder why you even bother with anything. The game doesn’t just make you doubt your skills; it makes you doubt everything in your life. What am I doing? Why haven’t I quit yet? The answers are out there... just not in this game.

The urge to throw your PC out the window has never been stronger. CS2 isn’t just a game; it’s a test to see how much abuse your hardware—and your sanity—can take. Every frustrating match brings you closer to smashing your computer to pieces. And honestly, after playing this, the thought of following it out the window doesn’t seem so crazy. You might also end up with permanent brain damage from how many times you’ll bash your head against the wall or your desk out of sheer frustration. Thanks, CS2, for turning a gaming session into a full-on mental breakdown!

So yeah, Counter-Strike 2 is the ultimate game for anyone who wants to lose all hope in humanity while driving themselves crazy. It’s not just a game—it’s a masterclass in why patience is overrated and sanity is optional. And yet, after all of this, it’s still somehow one of my favorite games. I can’t explain it, but for some ridiculous reason, I love this game, and I keep coming back for more. 10/10 would suffer through it all again..",Recommended,2912,670.1 hrs on record,"Posted: August 15, 2024"

Look, Duke Nukem Forever might have taken forever to arrive, but it’s packed with enough one-liners, explosions, and absurd testosterone to make up for it! 💣💪 If you’re in the mood for old-school action where logic takes a backseat to massive guns and alien butt-kicking, this game delivers it with a smug grin and a pair of sunglasses.

The arsenal? Ridiculous. The dialogue? Hilariously cheesy. The gameplay? Straight-up Duke—blowing stuff up, driving monster trucks, and tossing around aliens like it's the 90s all over again. 🎯

Sure, it’s not perfect, but perfection isn't Duke's style anyway. He’s here for carnage, explosions, and saving the babes. And let's be real, isn't that why we all came? 😎🔥",Recommended,634,378.3 hrs on record,"Posted: October 5, 2024"

2,100 hours later and I’ve finally learned that the only smoke I trust is the one I shoot through.
CS2 gave me prettier maps, shinier guns, and smokes that disappear the moment I pretend I can aim.
Anubis is still beautiful, AK still slaps, and my teammates still forget to buy armor.
The sub-tick system? Yeah, sure. I’ll believe it when my bullet hits before I’m dead.

lxb,https://steamcommunity.com/id/lxb/,"Dear CSGO Players, Let's Bring Cache Back!

We all know the pain. One day, Cache is here, then poof, gone. It was like a dream, a beautiful, tactical masterpiece where every angle was a potential frag, and every corner held a memory (usually of us getting blasted by someone with a P90). But it’s gone now. And we can’t let it slide.

Enter FMPONE’s Port, a map that gives us a glimmer of hope. This map is EVERYTHING we need to fill that Cache-sized hole in our hearts. And guess what? FMPONE wants it in the Premier rotation. Yeah, you heard that right. He's got the vision, and we’ve got the memes.



Let’s band together, let's flood Valve's inbox, let’s raise our voices and scream, “Cache was not just a map, it was a lifestyle!” We don’t care if they’ve added more maps to the rotation, we need our beloved Cache back in the game—and Port too, while we’re at it. If we can get this review trending like a clutch 1v5, it’s gonna be game over for Cache's absence.

So what do you say, fellow gamers? Let's use this meme weapon to resurrect Cache. Let's get the port into Premier rotation, because every CSGO player knows that nothing feels quite the same as taking back the A-site after a successful mid control on Cache.



This doesn’t apply to you, CS2 new gens. You’re out here playing “this fancy new game” while we’re just over here in the shadows, reminiscing about A-site smokes and the glory days of Cache. But hey, keep enjoying your new skins while we cry into our keyboards.
