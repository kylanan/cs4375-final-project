LouisDeFunes1914,https://steamcommunity.com/id/LouisDeFunes1914/,"Even after all the quality improvements and fixes, unfortunately, I still cannot recommend this product. Here’s what we have:

-Absolutely boring, empty maps, designed with a completely different idea that doesn’t fit the series.
-The complete lack of balance between the ""operatives,"" with a full map where only Falks are running around – this is often the norm.
-No single-player campaign.
-The ""Portal"" mode, which many had high hopes for (after all, it sounded so great, right? To play old Battlefield games in a modern wrapper with decent online play and all in one place) was abandoned, and in the end, we only have two not-so-great maps from 1942, BFBC2, and BF3.

In conclusion, I can only state that, even after all the changes, this is still the worst part since 2142 (Hardline at least had a good single-player campaign). Don’t waste your time on this empty shell, better wait for the next game (if you still believe in EA and DICE), or play the older games: V, I, and especially 4 (it deserves a much bigger online community, it really needs you).",Not Recommended,882,51.1 hrs on record,Posted: 6 January

SketchyBogan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SketchyBogan/,"So this is what happens when you design a Battlefield game without actually playing one! Despite all the updates, Battlefield 2042 remains a hollow experience. Empty maps, unbalanced operatives, no single-player, and a wasted ""Portal"" mode make this feel like the most disappointing Battlefield entry in years.
-----------------------------------------------------------------
Breakdown:
🔹 Story Quality: N/A – No single-player campaign.

🔹 Story Depth: N/A – Again, there’s no campaign, so there’s nothing to rate here.

🎮 Controls: The core gunplay and movement are decent, but nothing groundbreaking.

🌍 Immersiveness: Maps feel empty, lacking the chaos and dynamic combat that defined classic Battlefield games.

⚔️ Difficulty: The biggest challenge isn’t the enemies—it’s dealing with poor balancing and questionable design choices.

🗺 Level Design: Huge but lifeless maps that feel designed for a different game entirely.

🎨 Graphics: Visually, it looks good, but great graphics can’t save bad design.

🎵 Sound & Soundtrack: Serviceable, but lacks the impact of earlier Battlefield titles.

🕹 Gameplay: When it works, it’s fine, but poor balance and lackluster content make it a struggle to enjoy.

🐛 Bugs: Many fixes have improved stability, but early impressions still haunt the game.

⌛ Playtime: Depends on tolerance for frustration.

🔁 Replayability: Once you see the game’s flaws, there’s little reason to stick around.

💰 Price-to-Quality: Not worth full price, and even on sale, it’s a tough sell.

The Good:
✅ Decent gunplay and movement.

✅ Graphics are solid.

✅ Some fun moments—if you can find the right match.

The Bad:
❌ Empty, poorly designed maps.

❌ Zero single-player campaign.

❌ Completely unbalanced operatives (enjoy fighting Falks all day).

❌ ""Portal"" mode was abandoned.

Conclusion:
Battlefield 2042 was supposed to be a return to form, but even after updates, it remains a disappointing, empty experience. If you love Battlefield, you’re better off revisiting BF4, BF1, or BFV. This one just isn’t worth your time.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198086839230/,"FANS DESERVED BETTER THAN THIS

Battlefield 2042 is the latest installment in the long-running Battlefield franchise, developed by DICE and published by Electronic Arts. Set in a near-future world on the brink of collapse, it aims to deliver a high-stakes, large-scale first-person shooter experience. Marketed as a return to form after the disappointment of Battlefield V, it instead fell short of expectations - arguably becoming an even bigger misstep for the series.
As much as I’ve enjoyed the game since Season 5, I still can’t recommend it. Sure, the updates have been solid - DICE fixed, reworked, and added a lot of content - but it shouldn’t have taken so many months to get here.
The game launched in a terrible state, comparable to the rocky premieres of Cyberpunk 2077 and Fallout 76. And even now, it still falls short in many areas when stacked against previous Battlefield titles. I do appreciate DICE’s commitment to improving the game - especially when you consider how quickly Battlefield V was abandoned - but it’s simply not enough.


Disappointingly, there's no campaign mode at all.


Conquest (64 and 128), Close Quarter Conquest (64), and Breakthrough (64) are really the only default game modes that matter. I personally play almost exclusively in CQC - it’s intense and fast-paced - but unfortunately, the map pool is limited to just three. If you're looking for more variety, larger maps, or vehicle gameplay, Conquest and Breakthrough still hold up well. No complaints from me on that front.
Occasionally, the game introduces special events with unique modes and rewards. While they can be hit or miss, they offer players a welcome change of pace and something fresh to experience.


Battlefield Portal is an incredible concept that ultimately suffered from a lack of new content. It lets players create custom matches with a wide range of gameplay options and share them with the community. Overall, it's a fantastic feature that deserves to be a staple in future Battlefield games.


Hazard Zone is essentially an extraction shooter, aiming to be a Tarkov-lite set in the Battlefield universe. Unfortunately, it failed to capture interest, and as a result, it faded away quickly.


I’m one of those players who couldn’t care less about the specialists. Do I think it was a bad idea that doesn’t fit the Battlefield formula? Absolutely. Does it make the game unplayable or even significantly less enjoyable? Not really.
On one hand, I like the idea of gadgets and unique traits for each operator, but on the other hand, it's a bit odd to see 20 Sundances in a single match. With a few adjustments, it could be a fun gimmick in future Battlefield games - just don't make it the core focus.


Gunplay is always subjective, so I won’t spend too much time on it. Personally, I enjoyed it. It’s casual and doesn’t demand much mental effort - perfect for players who don’t have the time to master every nuance of the game. Most of the weapons are easy to handle, meaning even with average aim, you can still find yourself topping the leaderboards.
The TTK (time to kill) feels solid overall - fast enough to be satisfying, with the exception of three or four guns. As a result, enemies rarely feel like bullet sponges. That said, there are still issues with hit registration, lag spikes, and occasional desyncs. These problems can make the TTD (time to death) feel frustrating at times, as you can be one-shotted without any chance to fight back. While these issues aren’t as prevalent on smaller maps, they become much more noticeable in matches with 128 players.


I don’t have much to say about the vehicles in BF2042, since I rarely use them. The controls feel clunky, the vehicles move awkwardly, and flying helicopters and jets isn’t all that satisfying.


There’s no server browser, and it’s hard to understand why DICE was so determined not to include it. It remains one of the dumbest decisions they made.


Compared to older Battlefield games, this one feels like a step backward. Rather than enhancing the existing systems to allow for more impactful destruction, they scaled it back. Even visually, the explosions and building demolitions lack the satisfying impact we’ve come to expect.


The maps in Battlefield 2042 are a real mixed bag - some, like Spearhead, are solid, while others, like Kaleidoscope, miss the mark. The release maps were especially bad before their reworks. They were too large, too open, with vast flat terrains and hardly any cover. Thankfully, most of them are now at least playable.
It might be controversial (or maybe not?), but I genuinely think the later maps from the new seasons are fantastic. Redacted especially stands out - it's easily one of my all-time favorites in the Battlefield franchise.


I like the overall design of the HUD. It’s modern, minimalist, and provides all the essential information without cluttering the screen (for the most part). Unfortunately, the customization options are limited, so if you’re not a fan of the default HUD, you're pretty much stuck with it.
After several patches, the UI has become much more solid. The menus have been streamlined, and even something as simple as changing attachments is no longer a hassle.


In my opinion, the game looks (mostly) good. While the older maps could use some improvement - often feeling too clean and lacking in detail - the newer ones are visually stunning. Redacted is packed with incredible detail, while Exposure impresses with its breathtaking environmental design.
The dynamic weather is an impressive concept, but in the long run, it doesn’t quite deliver. While random tornadoes or sandstorms can add unpredictability to fights, they often don’t feel impactful enough. It would be better if these events were rarer but capable of causing real havoc on the battlefield.


Technically, the soundtrack isn't bad. It's solid electronic music with a subtle noise element. The problem, however, is that it doesn't suit the game. While it fits the theme, it doesn’t match the gameplay. What we need is something that hypes us up, something to pump adrenaline into our veins! This is an FPS, not a horror or sci-fi game.
The rest of the audio is decent. Nothing groundbreaking, but at least everything sounds as it should.


Performance heavily depends on the map and game mode you're playing. From my experience, fewer players usually means better FPS and less desync. That’s why I’ve always avoided the 128-player mode - it’s essentially a technical nightmare. Interestingly, newer maps seem to be better optimized compared to the older or reworked ones.
There are still a fair number of bugs and glitches. Aside from major issues like wonky hit registration and lag spikes, there are also smaller problems - like falling under the map or encountering flying vehicles.

Newtox,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Newtox/,"Battlefield 2042 Major Issues:

- Specialist system undermines traditional team play
- Oversized maps with poor flow and empty spaces
- Missing core Battlefield features at launch
- Simplified mechanics reduce tactical depth
- Disruptive weather effects hurt gameplay

What Went Wrong:

The departure from class-based gameplay to specialists fractured the series' signature teamwork. Maps feel stretched and lifeless despite the 128-player count, creating excessive downtime between engagements. The weather effects, while visually impressive, randomly disrupt tactical planning and gunfights.

Design Failures:

- Removal of scoreboard at launch
- Limited weapon selection
- Poor optimization and performance
- Lack of server browser
- Reduced environmental destruction

Impact on Gameplay:

The core Battlefield experience suffers from these fundamental changes. Gone are the strategic squad compositions and focused combat zones, replaced by lone-wolf gameplay and frustrating traversal times. The reduction in destruction and cover options limits the tactical options that made previous titles excel.

- Shooting, aiming and general movement feels awful especially if you plan on using a controller. Fine aiming is very awkward even with a mouse and after trying all kinds of sensitivity settings it still didn't feel good to play. Battlefield 4 and 5 do not have this problem and the controls are good by default so WTF happened with this?

- The majority of maps are way too big with huge areas of open space so have fun getting sniped, shot in the back or being gunned down by a passing helicopter which you had no way to avoid. Because the maps were designed with vehicles in mind there's a hell of a lot of running around if you aren't in one which means you will get sniped, shot in the back or gunned down by the previously mentioned helicopter.

- Major problems with hit detection. So many times i put half a magazine in to someone then they do a 180 and kill me in a quick burst of AR fire. I know i definitely shot them more than they shot me but there i am dead and thinking ""Why am i playing this?"".

It's basically become a worse, bigger version of Call Of Duty which is really sad because BF used to be a true alternative to COD with it's own unique style. Now it's a sweat fest where both teams camp opposite sides of a choke point and spam frags.

GayBoiRyan,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GayBoiRyan/,"I've been playing Battlefield 2042 these last few days since I picked it up on sale during the Steam Winter Sale. I've got to say, it is one of the blandest FPS games I've ever played or watched. Released four years ago, it feels like a shallow version of BF4. The maps are fairly mediocre; they lack the depth and design of BF4. The combat, while functional, lacks the thrill and some of the tactical variety that made BF4 memorable. Moreover, the grind to level up weapons is kind of tedious—a process that feels unrewarding and unnecessarily drawn out. Four years after its release, I'm freaking puzzled by how lifeless this game feels. If you're considering diving into Battlefield 2042, you might want to look at other titles in the series like Battlefield 4 or a different game entirely unless they add new content.

fremygaming,https://steamcommunity.com/id/fremygaming/,"its a good game, but not a good battlefield. My main gripes with the game is that having 9 operators in a battlefield of 128 players is ridiculous, it ruins immersion first of all, and the skills are not interesting. At least hide their faces so I'm not looking at 3 Irishes at the end screen. Also, having 128 players impacted the game negatively, the maps suck, its too much chaos that doesn't feel good, and I'm sure that the game was dumbed down to accommodate so many players. Both battlefield 1 and 5 look miles better, feel better and immerse me in a war like in bf1 mainly.

The movement speed also is too much, all operators being able to live without teammates sucks and all the weapons feel the same, unlike for example in bf1 you had to be prone to use certain weapons. This franchise is getting closer and closer to COD where teamworks matters null. Its obvious that these are new times and higher ups made them focus on things that aren't healthy for gameplay but for their wallets. Such is life.

axmaxwell,https://steamcommunity.com/id/axmaxwell/,"I understand why CoD has such a cult following. Gameplay is good, but not GREAT. The controls are very chunky/sloppy. Even low level AI can be hard to engage with when the game chooses to be laggy. Biggest issue here is bullet spread. To EA, every gun has the uncontrollable recoil of a 110 pound woman firing a 7.62 LMG standing. At approx 30 in game feet, the spread from a 5.56 rifle is 2-3 hits out of 10 rounds fired. Its just unrealistic.

Lobbies are few and far between. There is no feature in the game showing whats popular currently so you can join multiple matches and none of them launch. Player base is also massively inconsistent. Just because you had back to back matches at one time of day doesnt mean that anyone will be on the next day at the same time.

Weapons leveling/progression is REALLY bad. You get ONE of each weapon type to start unless you pay them for ELITE. Thats not worth it for a $60 game. Advanced Battlepass is at least forgiveable at $10/ea. Characters and skins are also bad. You get ONE operator for each class (class systems are a bad model for FPS games anyway, elite operators in the US military cross-train to do every job, not just a specification) and that one operator has a bunch of CoD-esque skins that are boring and not overly tactical or cool or fun, but a really bad mis-match of all 3.

Where this game shines is the modes. Its not perfect by any means, but the diversity of maps and capture-the flag type objectives is realistic to a military styled FPS. The CON of the modes is the imbalance of vehicles/positions. In some maps (Im looking at you, Caspian Border and Stranded) there are severe imbalances in the enemy AI and Vehicles that blatantly impact your teams ability to get the Win. On Stranded, the AI alone is able to hold off the enemy team and prevent progression at the very first capture mission, causing an immediate stalemate no matter now many of them your team kills. On Caspian Border, the RUS team gets a plane, and NONE of the available equipment, vehicles, or classes available to the USA team can down it. You will spend the entire match with your team spamming Stinger missiles only to have them all miss, cuz FLARES. The only aerial vehicle option for the USA is a Blackhawk, which is useless given its lack of air-to-air capabilities.

The number of hours that I have spent grinding and enjoying every minute of the franchise's fast paced war based scenarios is a time that I and many of my friends have cherished. I pre-ordered this game as I have done every battlefield since bad company. I played through the BETA and lived through the atrocious growing pains and hate this game received as the developers continued to fix what they broke during the BETA. After a rough start I decided it best to lay the game down for some time to let it develop, in hopes of coming back to a complete and truly remarkable game much like others in the franchise. This brings us to the present, after a very long time of letting the game develop and try its best to beat its predecessors I re-installed the game with such excitement. So much so that I even purchased copies of the game for friends in hopes of reliving our glory days. BOY WAS I WRONG!!!!! After only 2 days of playing the game after installation a total of 7.8 hours, both me and all the friends I purchased copies of this game for received the same email from EA customer service. The email stated that all of our accounts had received several cheating complaints and all of our accounts were banned. Please note that all of us have clean records with Steam, Origins, EA Play, Epic and essentially every other purchasing platform available with not even the slightest infraction of any kind whether that be cheating, inappropriate language, etc.. After spending the majority of the week contacting both Steam and the EA customer service team regarding the events that have taken place the conclusion of this everlasting battle stands that while no true reason for the ban was ever explained the verdict will remain in affect and none of the accounts will be reactivated. I have began the process of disputing the recent transactions on my account regarding this game with steam and the bank and have confirmed with the bank that all of these charges will be placed under charge back and will be disputed among the bank and steam moving forward. I have went into detail explaining this situation for you to let you know how EA has reached an all time low and I would not and will not be purchasing this game or any other EA product moving forward and I recommend you to do the same as you will more than likely receive the same ""Top Notch"" customer service the EA has provided me and my friends.

Levolution is absent and destruction is REALLY poor. In terms of balance, yes its a very balanced game between soldiers, vehicles and all. Vehicle piloting is actually perfect in this game, AA range is really balanced, only thing this game has over BF4. But 2042 SEVERELY lacks in variety and soul. Just as a direct example:

BF2042 has roughly 15 maps almost half of them are NOT playable through the default Conquest Game mode
BFV has 20 maps all playable through the default Conquest game mode.
BF1 has 29 maps all playable through the default Conquest game mode.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198411886342/,"I wish I could write an accurate review after I played this game but I could not even get that far along. The first time I ran the game after installing the mandatory EA App (which installs automatically when you run the game) I was greeted with the startup image and then a black screen that rendered my entire computer unresponsive. Had to shut the whole thing down manually by holding the physical power button on the PC like a barbarian. Great start, I know.

So to even get the game to run I had to re-verify the integrity of the game files via the steam dialog. Then I google searched the issue (which is apparently well documented enough to have multiple web articles about it) and had to clear the cache by running the repair tool for the EA app. Then sign back into the EA app. After that I could finally get the game to run and it put me in the introductory bot match.

The bot match was fun while it lasted, I guess. Pretty standard FPS gunplay stuff, the enemies where a little more bullet spongey that I am used to but I am nothing if not adaptable. My favorite part was when I spawned into a tank and tried to take down this attack helicopter that was murdering us. I thought it was a pretty neat detail that the tank main cannon cannot actually aim very high off the ground. Very realistic, I had to finagle the whole tank onto a hill so I could line up a shot. The helicopter blew up my tank, and then my bot teammates took it down before I could try again. But it was an endearing experience to me.

Anyway that was the first and last match I actually got to play in the game. After it finished I got taken to the main menu and looked around at all the guns, characters, and classes. Then I decided to try and play a real match. It was Friday so the had some Breakthrough game mode front and center, I think it was supposed to be like a 36v36 type deal. Anyway the game found a match pretty quickly and I was all set to join. Except I never made it in. After the screen would change to start loading into the match the game would crash. All 6 times I tried. With no error code. Just closed the game by itself. I changed the graphics settings from Auto (Which set everything to Ultra because I don't play on a potato anymore) to high as some people on the EA website suggested after the second crash. Didn't help. One person said that they had good results with turning down their ram frequency from 3500 to 3466. I didn't do that because I am not gonna fiddle around with my bios setting to possibly, maybe be able to play this game. I don't do that kinda thing for any other game in my library, because all of those just work after I install them.

Its so fast, there are so few maps, what maps there are aren't balanced well, and the class identity is so muddy there's no point aside from the one piece of special gear each one gets.
Vehicles have so much health that you can only seem to destroy them with a full retinue of C4 and Rush devolves into everyone igniting the objective or just throwing scatter grenades.

All due to inactivity BECAUSE THEY WON'T GIVE ME ACCESS. I don't think they're even allowed to just delete it, but whatever.

As it turns out, most of the core staff around Battlefield left DICE when development for BF2042 started. Most of them have gone to other, more competent studios. The release of 2042 was horrific. Terrible open beta, terrible PR, and then a horrific release. Bugs, lag, performance issues, and just terrible gameplay. I have played every Battlefield game except Hardline, and can honestly say that this is by far the worst.

After several fixes and improvements, the game is overall better, sure. But the core gameplay is still so far from any decent Battlefield game that I just can't recommend it.

inyusha,https://steamcommunity.com/id/inyusha/,"This game plays like it was developed by a bunch of first-time devs straight out of uni. Ignoring the terrible state of the game at launch in terms of bugs and optimization, the game released with fundamentally bad gameplay. Over the years since launch the developers have changed some superficial aspects of gameplay, but overall have failed to make the game fun from moment to moment. Years of development post-launch have seen little new content, no real gameplay changes, and few optimizations. The game still runs terribly, lacks for map variety, and is simply not fun to play for prolonged periods. My typical experience with this game is a 3-5 minute boot period, followed by a minute long queue, followed by a minute long loading screen, followed by an endgame screen because I got backfilled into a game that was ending, followed by another minute long queue (most lobbies do not persist between games), followed by another minute long loading screen, before finally beginning a game. I get a 'battlefield moment' once every few months, but otherwise I only play this game to turn my brain off, not when I actually want to have fun playing a well-made game. 90% of my sessions end in alt-f4s because I get killed by an enemy that hasn't loaded in and isn't visible, or I spawn in front of an enemy, or I get killed by a vehicle that can destroy all anti-vehicle projectiles which get near it, or for any other number of generally frustrating reasons. Very rarely do I actually get a real team vs team gunfight or experience any squadplay, and while these moments are enjoyable, they are only enjoyable because of the other players enabling it. I could have the same positive gameplay experiences in almost any other multiplayer game, but only in battlefield 2042 do I have so many negative experiences that are clear products of simple bad game design. In short, there are no positive experiences unique to 2042, and the sparseness of any fun gameplay makes it impossible to recommend this game.

Pros:
1. The guns feel solid and it is extremely satisfying to kill players.
2. Maps are cool
3. The guns feel suuuper satisfying, like really good. I can't emphasize enough how great the guns feel. This may be a hot take for some but I like it.
Cons:
1. Spawns are atrocious. I have spawned and immediately gotten killed because I was within line of sight of an enemy player. I once spawned, walked a few feet, had a teammate spawn on me, then watched as he was sniped in front of me.
2. Operator system is gimmicky and is boring. It doesn't make sense when your an American operator playing for the Russian side.
3. Hit registraition feels off at times but it's probably just me.
4. For some reason the game takes 100% of my CPU. Even with low graphics and finely tuned settings this happens. I have never had this issue even with intensive games like Red Dead 2. This makes it hard to have any other process running like discord. This could be an issue on my end but like i said, never had this issue with huge games like Red Dead 2.
Overall, maybe buy the game if it's on sale and you want something to mess around in. Otherwise don't buy it for the 60$ it normally is.",Not Recommended,1121,8.4 hrs on record,"Posted: June 30, 2024"

Honestly, long time battlefield fan. loved BF1942, absolutely loved Hardline, my favorite was BF1. Preordered this game as soon as it was announced. Rocky release, had some fun, but it didn't live up to earlier releases and i switched to a different game within the week. cant remember which game. Just bought this game again (Switched to PC from console) for the same price i pre-ordered it at!
Bullet spread is bloomy and not what i'm used to

DovahkiinKanda,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DovahkiinKanda/,"It's definitely not worth more than $5, that's where it should have been priced at launch then it wouldn't have been a problem. It's ok-ish I guess, too much of the same as BF3 and 4 but with bits of CoD.

Biggest issues here:

It is a $60 game yet has a battlepass, a battlepass which weapons are sometimes locked behind (I don't care if they can be obtained without purchasing the battlepass, they shouldn't be in the battlepass). It somehow manages to dsync/disconnect while in singleplayer, they could definitely afford to have some better servers but instead opt to go with walmart servers. Snipers are boring and have low capacity/fire rates and reloads, maybe it's not as annoying in pvp but against bots it's so boring. Gadgets and vehicle weapons have been nerfed so bad that I don't know why they're still even here, like I expect a Abrams 120mm cannon to kill infantry just fine but it's more likely to get ♥♥♥♥ marks unless it's a direct impact. Attack heli is a joke, it has 8 rockets that are quite off from the crosshair, again needs to pretty much be direct impact, rate of fire is so slow also. Countermeasures seem to be completely useless now also, deploy smoke or ECM and the missile will still hit just fine, so why have countermeasures? One of the Engineer special kits also will bug all vehicle camera use for the user sometimes, I'm not sure what causes this but it's the player guided rocket. Surprisingly it takes longer to load in matches than moving planets in Starfield lol. Maps are kinda bland but after BF4 that's kinda expected(after playing more, there are some that are actually pretty decent).

Cosmetics are ass but that can easily be avoided, they look so trash though, like Ubisoft level bad. I'm not sure who they are aiming for with them yet most characters are like 50+ years old and look like they were pulled out of a rest home. Weapon charms, always ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ hated these lazy low effort ♥♥♥♥, give us ♥♥♥♥ rings and butt plugs. Also a bit disappointed we don't have a Boe Jiden but we have a black Andrew Tate as a character lol

Get it on a $5 sale or just give it a hard pass, asking $60 for this is insane. There is at least 5 to 10 hours of enjoyment to be had then I imagine it's gonna get stale like the previous Dice games.

Overall I give it the rating of Ubisoft, AAAA, the devs had their heads up each others asses with this one.

Danturn,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Danturn/,"Battlefield 2042 is almost the antithesis of what the Battlefield series represented in its prime. When compared to classics like Battlefield: Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, and Battlefield 1, it's easy to see how far the series has fallen.

Lack identity
Each of the previous games had something unique: Bad Company 2 – satisfying destructible environments and humor; Battlefield 3 – stunning realism and Battlefield 1 – the haunting atmosphere of World War I. Battlefield 2042 feels like a patchwork of incoherent ideas. The maps are enormous but empty and lack any real character. They’re missing the dynamism and atmosphere that drew fans to the series for years.

Gameplay Mechanics – Senseless Chaos
The game aimed to introduce modern technologies and larger maps, but the result is uncontrollable chaos. Traditional class roles have been replaced by ""Specialists"", which has completely ruined the sense of teamwork. Gameplay is chaotic and devoid of any strategy – players run in random directions instead of working together to achieve objectives. Where is the spirit of team play that earlier titles captured so well?

No progress, just a step backward
In conclusion, Battlefield 2042 is a massive disappointment and a step back for the series. While Bad Company 2, Battlefield 3, and Battlefield 1 had a clear style and wowed with innovations, 2042 feels completely lost, offering players bland, frustrating, and unpolished gameplay that doesn’t come close to its predecessors.

TheBlondGuy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/TheBlondGuy/,"God did I not want to put a negative review on this game.

A Terrible Beginning
Battlefield 2042 had a disastrous launch, sadly reminiscent of Cyberpunk 2077. The pervasive bugs, performance issues, and missing features left a deplorable first impression among players, especially casual players like myself.

Gradual Improvement
However, it must be acknowledged that the game has significantly improved with each update. The developers have worked hard to fix the initial errors, introduce new features, and enhance the overall experience. Today, Battlefield 2042 is much more enjoyable and visually pleasing (we're FAR from what we've seen in the reveal trailer tho). Despite these improvements, Battlefield 2042 still suffers from the negative reputation of its launch. Many casual players, including myself, haven't been able to forget this chaotic start. This negative perception persists, even though the game has made significant progress since then.

Another major negative point is the complete absence of a story mode, which is disappointing for a game of this price. For me, Battlefield 2042 is not worth its current price, especially when compared to previous games in the series. Unfortunately, this game cannot be considered a true Battlefield worthy of its name. Compared to Battlefield 3, which captivated me for days & days, Battlefield 2042 fails to offer the same level of satisfaction and depth.

I want to commend the developers' efforts to maintain the game. It's nice to see that they haven't abandoned the project. However, neither Call of Duty nor Battlefield can bring back the joy I used to feel. I even replayed Battlefield 3 recently to confirm that it's not just nostalgia.

After hours of gameplay, it's disappointing to realize that you've seen it all and there's nothing left to discover. It's unclear what direction the developers wanted to take or what they intended to achieve with this game.

In conclusion, although Battlefield 2042 is an acceptable game today, it is very far from the excellence of Battlefield 3 or even Battlefield 1. Unfortunately, it doesn't follow the Battlefield editorial line, leaving me with a negative opinion despite its improvements.",Not Recommended,1862,23.6 hrs on record,"Posted: May 23, 2024"

Gunplay is solid, sound design is excellent, map design is pretty fun with a reasonable sense of scale. I enjoy the weapons (though I'm not a fan of swapping attachments on the fly), and the TTK feels perfectly tuned.

However, this is a massive leap back in quality from previous Battlefield entries. Graphically it somehow looks worse than much older games in the franchise, and there are so many baffling game design choices here. Battlefield is a hero shooter now??? What? The entire point of the series is to immerse yourself in a warzone, and that's hard to do when you're fighting multiple combatants using the same named character. Cloning technology has really advanced in 2042, apparently.

It's also very much made accessible for the lowest common denominator. This can be a pro or a con depending who you are talking to, but as a long time Battlefield fan it simply feels gutted. Don't even get me started on the forced diversity, cringe opening statements you must agree to, and battle pass nonsense constantly shoved in your face.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199194806852/,"this game sucks. play battlefield 1 or 4, theyre leagues better than this.
to start, the tone is all over the place. the backstory implies that this game is meant to be a darker approach around famine and ♥♥♥♥, but the characters and visuals make it feel like its supposed to be some quirky fortnite/apex legends knockoff.
another thing i disliked was the movement. seeing the huge maps, i expected characters to be speedier and for the movement to have a more parkour-ish feel, but no. its just the movement of previous games injected into a map eight times too big and none of the space to make up for it.
the gunplay also felt really off. the animations were some kind of janky mw2019 parody, which trying to do with the battlefield's gun animation style feels like trying to jam a square peg into a circular hole. the sound design felt so unsatisfying too, it felt like i was listening to it underwater. there's no ""oomf"" to anything, unlike the previous games in which my love for them was greatly assisted by the amazing sound design (bf1 my beloved).

MisterQuasar,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MisterQuasar/,"Genuinely the worst Battlefield game I have ever played. Where do I even start with this pile of ♥♥♥♥...

This game has such a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ terrible unlock system. It's either ""Hey, level up a ♥♥♥♥ ton"" or ""hey, you need to do both of these obnoxious things to unlock me"", and sometimes a mix of both. To unlock some guns, I need to just get headshots or something, which is fine, but then the second task is use another gun and do X and Y with it before unlocking... not to mention this gun you're forced to use is likely the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ gun in said weapon class. Then we move to the attachments? Literally just get kills... yeah sometimes ADS or hipfire kills or whatever, but only kills... weapon xp isn't a thing, this is a mistake. Being forced to get kills with ♥♥♥♥ weapons just to unlock things, yep seems like amazing and fun gameplay. Absolutely stupid. Whilst writing up to this point, I was checking out some things in game and just came across this for a weapon unlock to give a basic idea of what I mean...so, unlock a new sniper, 60 kills or assists with the base sniper. Now that seems absolutely fine, no? Agreed. But the second unlock? Spot 100 enemies on SOFLAM... ""bro that's literally so easy why are you crying"" oh yeah my bad sorry I need to grind my way up to level ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ 56 just to unlock the SOFLAM, which I will use for those 100 spots then likely forget about an hour later.

Next? Can it really get worse? Apparently it can. No matter what ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ map I play on, I always join a team that is just getting held at one point or at spawn. ""don't go down the middle"" yeah good luck going anywhere else because some little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ rat ♥♥♥♥ is just sitting prone in every ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ corner waiting for a flank, so my choice is either see these rat bastards or go down the centre of the map and get ganged up on by about 400 people, who probably have went through at least 17 keyboards within 2 months with the amount of ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ grenade spam in this game. Then when I push up if there's an opening, nevermind... my team will sit behind their ♥♥♥♥♥♥ little see through shields at the back of the map, doing ♥♥♥♥ all to help. The game is literally impossible to win. More open map? Some random ♥♥♥♥-off sniper just sitting in the middle of nowhere just 'cuz, I mean I love sniping in Battlefield games but this game also feels like it has the worst hit-reg for snipers I have ever played with. Not to mention half the time you are ♥♥♥♥♥♥ because you can't shoot through all these weird small cracks because that would literally employ fun into the game, and you can't shoot whilst prone because the floor just munches on your ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ sniper rounds because why tf not.

The one thing that is ""fine"" in this game is the Operators, I think they're unique and I like how they all bring some different buffs, however they aren't all good... I remember seeing the grapple gun thinking it'll be awesome, and honestly it was half the reason I wanted to try this game so much... literally the single worst thing I have ever used. Half the time it can't reach something 2m in front of it, and then that stupid annoying reload... yeah it doesn't take long, but if the thing just connected in the first place I wouldn't have to reload the damn thing. Not to mention using it, it has like a whole 1+ minute cooldown I swear, it is ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ atrocious.

One other thing that is actually pretty neat is weapons aren't class specific. If you wanna use a sniper whilst playing as a medic, you can! But playing it as a Recon will just give it class specific bonuses, which is really nice and I think that's a good way to do these types of games.

I have never had so little fun playing a Battlefield game, buying this game on sale stills feels like a waste of my money, and time playing this game. I actually went to refund it and then realised I had 2.2 hours, successfully wasting my money on a game that brings me nothing but misery.

I'm not normally one to complain too much when a game developer isn't perfect. Making games is hard; pleasing whiny gamers is even harder. But I would be shocked if even a single member of the development team that made Battlefield 1942 had anything to do with this product, and if they did then the apple has fallen far, far from the tree.

A great deal of the problems with the Battlefield series and this installment in particular almost certainly lie at the feet of a myriad array of faceless EA managers and executives who pocket their profits without a care in the world for the art of video games, but that doesn't explain everything. No, there are clear, deliberate design decisions and thinking (or lack thereof) that could only have come from a developer or two or twenty who implemented it, looked at it, playtested it, and said ""yeah, I'm ok with this.""

Battlefield 1 was a rare fluke where the franchise actually managed to capture something interesting. It had its flaws, but it was the last BF that had any soul. 2042 is just another pale, exsanguinated corpse shambling around in grotesque imitation of a series that once revolutionized online FPS gameplay; mass-produced dreck that exists only to extract profit so that some manager can say he hit his metrics this fiscal quarter.",Not Recommended,1130,34.5 hrs on record,"Posted: July 11, 2024"

BLACKCARBON,https://steamcommunity.com/id/BLACKCARBON/,"Still the worst Battlefield by far. The guns are horribly unbalanced, the vehicles are horribly unbalanced and the worst part is still the map design. open everywhere and absolutely zero spawn protection whatsoever. The maps are too open and the ease of getting from one point to the next is just atrocious. If you plan on playing this game by yourself alone there's a few things to note before buying.
1. This game is cancerous when it comes to team balancing. Nobody spots anyone, most people in conquest have never heard of an objective and 90 percent of people are not team players as medics and support are rare. Remember this game was a scam on release.
2. If you think much has changed since the beta YOU'RE WRONG. I stomached it for 68 hours and I dare not make it 69 even an hour more of gun play. Smoke grenades are your best friend since people won't run into or shoot into them UNLESS they're camping a tight hallway with a mobile gatling sentry in the engineer class (THEY HAVE UNLIMITED AMMO). Vehicles are not worth trying to get, you'll spend all your game time waiting.
3. Spawn camping is real. trying to spawn on points being contested will most likely put you in front of an enemy who is watching the spawn point waiting with more than 1 person and if you manage to kill one of them there's always a medic to help them.
Long story short the game is still unbalanced. 90 percent of attachments have debuffs that make them pointless. Just use the battlefield 3 weapons because the stats are unchanged they've just copied them over I recommend the M4A1 because everything else is trash.

Better yet. Don't buy the game. My honest opinion it's worth 5 bucks. no more. the content is all monetized. 4 player skins per operator that require 72 hours of gameplay if your as good as me. I gave up at time of review. I just wasn't enjoying it anymore. I hope any of me sharing this sways your opinion because they don't deserve your money for this.

This game especially is pure chaos. There are explosions everywhere, people shooting at you through smoke and flames, snipers killing you without you even knowing they exist, and the level difference in this game is absurd - if you are low level you get weapons that do so little damage it feels like you're actually healing the enemy when you shoot him, meanwhile when you get to a high level you get smgs that two-shot snipers from hundreds of meters away and literally explosive sniper rifles that oneshot (body) everyone from any distance, regardless of if they have a shield or not.

If you are looking for a game that feels like being on a literal battlefield, without you understanding anything that's happening, then this game is definitely for you - otherwise, don't even bother.

Usually, even in games I don't like, I end up having highs and lows in my experience, and I usually find at least something to praise the game for, even if the overall experience has been negative. Not this time. Everything feels out of place, unbalanced, unstructured, unregulated, uneven, unto muzunna cara and there has not been ONE match where I actually ended up having fun, even by being on top of the leaderboard.

This game genuinely made me heavily rethink other pvp experience, and I swear that, after playing a handful of matches, I seriously wanted to hop on CoD TO RELAX .

You should be aware that without the Elite upgrade (30 bucks), a good chunk of content is just inaccessible. At the end of the day, it's still a BF game for 5 bucks, but it feels so incredibly cheap it's kinda disgusting. The menus and load times are horrendous on my machine, however the gameplay has felt very smooth I should give credit there. The main menu you're greeted with looks like a mobile game, I really hate that this is what it's come to but alas. Everything appears to be locked behind premium currency, premium cosmetics and the battlepass feel plastered over every screen and what this purchase has really made me realise is: THANK GOD I DID NOT PAY FULL PRICE FOR THIS PILE OF TRASH LMAO

Seriously though, do not pay full price for this, if you're new to BF go straight to BF1 or older please, BF2042 is a Battlefield for those who have played all the other entries in the series and want something else to do, if that's you, then yeah, for 5 bucks why not.


EDIT: Never mind, I actually went and refunded this absolute garbage before I went over the 2 hour limit. Of the hour and 40 minutes I spent in the game, less than half was actually spent playing. The intro has you playing a short round of conquest vs bots and that bit is actually a lot of fun, but it all goes downhill so fast it's honestly impressive. The game is always online, so if you have a bad connection, forget about it. My connection is fine and I still lagged like crazy, so I decided to give the solo/coop mode a try. Nope, it's also online.

Finally, after staring at yet another loading screen for 3 minutes I just alt F4'd out of the game and uninstalled it, on top of everything else wrong with this game it's also just loading screen after loading screen, which is made even worse by the fact that this trash game loves to drop you in empty servers. Even leaving a game leads to a slow loading screen, it's absolutely ridiculous and I refuse to believe this was made by the same people that made BF1, it's impossible.

b1ue_hawk,https://steamcommunity.com/id/b1ue_hawk/,"Title: Battlefield 2042 – A Revolutionary Leap Backward

Oh, Battlefield 2042, where do I even begin? What a groundbreaking masterpiece of mediocrity! EA and DICE truly outdid themselves this time by creating a game that takes the series in a bold new direction—straight into the dumpster. Let’s break down all the ""amazing"" features that make this game the pinnacle of disappointment.

1. The Perfectly Balanced 128-Player Chaos:
Nothing screams ""fun"" like getting sniped from a kilometer away by someone you didn’t even see, while your entire squad spawns into a warzone that looks like a traffic jam. 128 players in one map? Genius! It’s not like smaller, more focused team-based gameplay was ever a thing, right? I mean, who needs coordination when you can just run around like a headless chicken?

2. Maps as Vast as the Sahara (And Just as Exciting):
If you enjoy running… and running… and then dying before you even spot the enemy, Battlefield 2042 has the perfect maps for you! The vast, barren landscapes make you feel like a true soldier lost in a desert, minus the fun of actually finding water. And the cover? Oh, don’t worry, there’s plenty of it... if you’re into hiding behind a rock for 20 minutes.

3. Bugs, Glitches, and Features—Oh My!
Why fix bugs when you can just call them “features”? Hovercrafts scaling buildings? Iconic. Rubberbanding through walls? Classic. Want to spawn without a gun? Consider it a challenge mode! DICE really knows how to keep players on their toes by throwing random, game-breaking ""surprises"" your way every five minutes.

4. The Cutting-Edge Specialists System:
Because who doesn’t love playing as generic heroes with cringe-worthy voice lines instead of soldiers that actually fit the Battlefield universe? Thanks, EA, for giving us Specialists with abilities that nobody asked for. It’s like they looked at other popular shooters and thought, ""What if we took their worst ideas and shoved them into Battlefield?""

5. Weather Effects That Blow You Away... Literally:
Tornados in the middle of combat? Truly revolutionary. It’s not like I wanted to focus on gameplay anyway. The fact that you can get sucked into a natural disaster while trying to capture a point is pure brilliance. Why worry about strategy when Mother Nature can randomly wipe you off the map?

6. The Infinite Customization of Weapons (Or Lack Thereof):
The weapon selection is so limited, you might as well be back in the stone age. But hey, at least you can customize your gun’s attachments mid-fight, because we all know that nothing says “immersive” like attaching a scope while dodging sniper fire. What a time to be alive!

7. A Revolutionary Absence of a Campaign:
Who needs a single-player campaign, anyway? Instead of giving us a story, EA decided we’d have more fun staring at a “no content” screen. Truly a visionary approach to game design. It’s almost as if they were saving us from enjoying the game too much.

In conclusion, Battlefield 2042 is the future of gaming. If the future is a rushed, buggy mess with soulless design choices, of course. Thanks, EA, for delivering a game that truly lives up to the phrase ""less is more""... by offering so much less.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198044219831/,"Honestly, I really want to like this game. There's parts of it that are so much fun, and some parts that are evocative of the nature of a Battlefield franchise game, but EA might as well be the mark of death for a developer to publish under. 2042 is still poorly optimized on a decent build and loads incredibly slow, and no amount of game integrity checks or hotfixes has ever gotten this game to run smoothly.

""But Ferret,"" I hear you say, ""Have you ever tried (insert X fix here) to get your game to run better?"" No, I've certainly tried, but moreover I should not have to rely on an external support network to fix a game that is still 60 USD 4 years after launch. I should not have to sit and wonder why even though I meet the 'recommended' specs, the game barely runs smooth on medium graphical settings.

Map design is poorly done and horrendously inconsistent whether you're conducting combat as a vehicle or foot-soldier, TTKs are wildly imbalanced, the Crysis-esque attachment system is cool, but clunky to use in overall gameplay, and some of the gadgets are just straight up stupidly imbalanced. Map destruction physics are all but non-existant at this stage, and it's really unfortunate to see that some of the series-defining features have been reduced to little more than a party trick gimmick.

Could I recommend this game on good faith? No. I wouldn't even do so on bad faith. EA themselves could pay me twice whatever they spent marketing this slop, and I'd sooner use it to run a campaign AGAINST the marketing of the game to the wider audience of the world simply because this game doesn't know what it wants to be. I'm not sure it's a Battlefield game, or a Call of Duty game, or a Squad, or an Arma, because it lacks so much of the identity of the games it tries to emulate and compete against that I'd sooner recognize it as any other game had it not had the Battlefield tag slapped onto it.

And that's the real crux of the issue. DICE has lost their way or lost good employees, and they've already more than moved on to the next Battlefield game, and I can only hope with a severely large dose of medical-grade copium that they can actually produce a game worthy of the title, but like any other AAA dev studio publishing under a AAA publishing label, we might as well start reducing the amount of A's in their promises to develop an experience and replace them with a couple S's.

The only thing this game is now is ASS. Not AAA. Not AAAA(although it certainly invokes the feeling of wanting to vocalize that in frustration), not even Indie. There are mods and early access games with more promise and passion than was put into this whole thing from start to finish, and the fact that this was a fun game at moments and points showed that it had potential that was promptly wasted by greedy corporate devs and publishers that don't know why games are called games.

They might waste the potential of a Battlefield game, and they're free to do so, but don't waste your money trying to see the light in this. Save it for anything else.",Not Recommended,2509,99.4 hrs on record,Posted: April 30
Shevi2k,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Shevi2k/,"Truly the worst Battlefield ever released.
Portal is the only good thing in this game. Vehicles are almost unkillable unless you have at least one other player willing to use their AT equipment. It doesn't sound like it's something difficul - but trust me, it is. Very often, you have 15 engineers on your team, and you will NOT see a single rocket fired at enemy vehicles.

Until the recent nerfs to the Littlebird, a decent pilot could easily stomp entire matches because you either can't spawn an AA vehicle (which your team uses against infantry in 9/10 matches for some reason) or the AA gadgets require locking onto targets. A pilot with 5 functioning brain cells will pop flares, then return to their spawn for 15 seconds until the flares recharge. Only the Lis rocket (specialist gadget) can actually hit helis and jets, but it doesn’t one-shot vehicles, so it’s almost useless against air targets, which will escape quickly after getting hit by it. On top of that, a pilot must be deaf, because you can hear this rocket several seconds before impact.

You can play any weapon on any class, which takes the Battlefield recon plague to a whole new level. Now, you’ll not only see useless recons who apparently can’t even press their spot keybind, but also supports with medkits on the other side of the map, trying to get one or two kills over a 40-minute match with their bolt-action rifle and 16x scope, while the objective is outside their render distance.

The map pool is small and terrible. I can’t even recall a worse map from previous Battlefields.
Map destruction is almost gone. Most of the time, you can only destroy glass panels. Forget about blowing up walls or entire buildings.

Auto-aim at distances lower than 25m is a joke, and the reduced bullet spread on gamepads is also a joke.

I do hear them reply, but they NEVER do anything to help me, or they take forever to get to my location.

And don't get me started on the janky- teleporting AI moments, sometimes AI will legit dodge like Ultra Instinct Goku! And It's honestly outrageous.

The PvP Is ok at best as well, but how people are now a days In video games.. Aka the try hard thinking he's playing a 1,000,000$ cash cup competitive tournament loser, who just curves stomp lobbies cause people for some reason wanted no SBMM, which SBMM should be In every PvP like game..

In all honesty I am just- Angered on how they made this game, the battlepass.. The skins.. AND EVEN PUT A GUN IN THE PASS THAT YOU HAVE TO UNLOCK FROM THE PASS, It's so bad, they are greedy and now scummy to me.. I'd suggest just going back to Hardline, or BF4, or BFBC..

Would I suggest this to friends? Yes and No.

Yes - If they are a PvE player like me, then yes.. Co-Op Is the place to stay! Since you grind out your weapons and Items and play with them In real games. And If- your some person that has a lot of money, and likes skins then go ahead, give them money.. (Even though your supporting their greed.)

2) the interface sucks, took me 3 damn weeks to know how the game actually works like where to chane kit or character or edit vehicles (im a battlefield veteran)
3) the only actual working weapon is an LMG, because the bullets do 0 damage and by the time u reload your enemy would have healed, sometimes i drive a tank and because it does 0 damage i exit it to kill players with my gun, thats how bad the situation is
4) there are so many bugs and cheaters
5) all the servers have bots, like bruh this feels like playing singleplayer
6) the spawning really sucks, enemies can literally only aim at 1-2 locations and spawn kill u since these would be the only spawns.
7) if u are playing hardcore and u spawn on your teammate, u spawn directly infront of him. i died so many times by my teammates because they would be shooting someone and i spawn right infront of them and i get killed
8) anti-tank weapons are useless because u need like 6-7 rockets to destroy a tank

Xianyu2,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Xianyu2/,"It's just not very good.

Sure, the addition of AI helps, but all of the little ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ of the battlefield series are here in the worst ways and they added some entirely new ones! Like the fact that vehicles are still STUPIDLY overpowered and no matter how hard you try, you, individually, can do literally nothing against vehicles and you'll just get killed by them over and over and over and over and over and over and there's nothing you can do about it because your team won't ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ help. You get emp grenades that can disable vehicles though! Cute joke. They don't do anything except give you more score. 'Wheels disabled'? Cute joke. Why is it still driving away at full speed?

Used to be you could spam enough missiles at helicopters to get a disable and then knock them down, make them smash into a building, etc. This game? Nah. I've literally never hit an air vehicle with a missile in this game because they made the flares stupidly overpowered. And then they just fly away to reload their flares. What ENGAGING GAMEPLAY.

Same with ground vehicles. Damage them? Oh well, they'll drive away and auto-repair. Or just use some ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ ability that completely nullifies your missiles, because THAT'S what ground vehicles were missing in battlefield games, HARD KILL ANTI MISSILE DEFENSE. My god who the ♥♥♥♥ thought was a good idea? I just looked it up and read this description:

'Active Defense lasts for five seconds. It takes twelve seconds to recharge. The forcefield radius is six meters on ground vehicles and ten meters on air vehicles. Active Defense can be activated while the vehicle is immobilized by EMP.'

You thought mbts were cancerous in battlefield 4? Well now they get active missile defenses they can toggle on that completely nullify incoming damage 30% of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ time, which allows them to shoot through it and can be ACTIVATED WHILE THEY'RE EMP'D.

You'd think 'wow, that must be because we get cool new anti-tank gadgets or something'. Lol NOPE. You get anti-tank mines, a dumbfire launcher, a lock on launcher, and a ToW launcher. Oh and the anit-air lock on launcher.

That's it.

The exact same options as BF4, except now they gave vehicles the ability to completely NULLIFY all incoming damage HOORAY! Like they looked at previous bf games and said 'what is this missing? Hey, you know those vehicles that ruined the previous games because they were stupidly overpowered against infantry and any idiot with two brain cells to rub together could completely dominate any number of enemy players trying to stop?

savagepavich,https://steamcommunity.com/id/savagepavich/,"Enjoyable FPS, Mediocre Battlefield
Battlefield 2042 had the worst BF launch I've ever seen in my life, but it's somehow managed to claw it's way back to something that's somewhat enjoyable, but only if you're willing to look at this game as a goofy spin-off and not a mainline Battlefield title. Why? Because while 2042 plays like every other hyper-movement modern shooter it has little to no teamwork, the ""revamped"" classes are the same silly character operators and the maps are honestly forgettable, vacant and obnoxiously massive. The hyped up ""Portal"" mode is probably the most disappointing aspect of 2042, if anything it feels like a half-baked knock-off of the older BF titles you played before. It's a great idea, but poorly executed (like many things in this game). Oh, and of course there's the in-game store complete with hideously tacky skins and cosmetics you can buy with IRL money.

BF3 Portal is more fun than 2042 itself, especially with absolutely overpowered SMAW that has an insane blast radius and damage, they regularly publish Portal playlists with BF3/BC2 content (sometimes you may end up playing 2042 maps instead).

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198280154111/,"Battlefield 2042 is fun to play, but it could use some key improvements to enhance the experience. One of the biggest missing features is a solo “Aircraft Training Ground” where players can practice flying helicopters, jets, and drones without the pressure of live combat. Mastering these vehicles is crucial, yet the game offers no proper space to learn them.

Suggestions to the Developers & Studio:

🔹 Optimize Matchmaking for Low Player Count: Since the active player base is limited, consider rotating game modes instead of splitting players across multiple lobbies. For example:
• Hour 1: Conquest 64
• Hour 2: Conquest 128
• Hour 3: Breakthrough
• Hour 4: Death match
• Hour 5: Portal

This way, a single lobby would have more real players rather than being filled with bots, which often ruins the experience.

🔹 Increase Free Weekends: More frequent free weekends would help attract new players and keep them engaged. Battlefield thrives on large-scale warfare, and a bigger player base would significantly improve match quality.

With these changes, Battlefield 2042 could reclaim its potential and deliver the immersive, large-scale battles that fans expect.",Recommended,993,62.1 hrs on record,Posted: February 19
ThatSelousGuy,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ThatSelousGuy/,"It certainly has a lot of problems, from the awful launch, to the lack of initial direction, and the removal of legacy features that had to be added in post-launch, plus the rushed and last minute story that is somehow less interesting than 3 and 4's.
That being said, the core gameplay is as polished and as refined as Hardline and 5's, the simple changes to the formula with the new classes and abilities drastically change the regular play style, and the maps where 128 players can function properly are genuinely enjoyable.
Given that this game is now in end-of-life, if you can pick this up for cheap, it is a blast to play with pals, and you can have genuine fun. Battlefield is a very difficult formula to screw up in one game.

efirov,https://steamcommunity.com/id/efirov/,"So, this is yet another game and franchise that was ruined by corporate greed and ambition. It had a rough start, with numerous bugs, missing features, and overall poor design decisions. I missed much of the initial chaos and played mostly after the major fixes, so my perspective might be a bit biased. However, when I finally tried it, the game was already fun and improved significantly over the years. They fixed and redesigned many problematic aspects, added new content, and ironed out most of the bugs. I didn't encounter any noticeable issues during my ≈70 hours of gameplay. The gameplay is solid now, definitely capable of delivering those classic battlefield™ moments. It's just a shame that the destruction aspect was downgraded so much. Once a staple of the franchise, it's now taken a backseat. Environmental hazards like tornadoes are fun occasionally, but they should complement, not replace, the great destruction mechanics (and possibly Levolution also).

One aspect that is rarely mentioned is the potential of its theme and setting. Its uniqueness and potential were sadly overlooked, as it's essentially only represented by some text in the menus, overshadowed by cheesy, cringe-worthy character dialogues. Surprisingly, I found the music to be a highlight. It offers a unique and interesting take on Battlefield's iconic and beloved themes, composed by a really talented musician. Overall, it's a real shame. This game had potential, but it was undercooked and almost immediately disregarded. Support for Portal and BR modes was dropped almost from the start, and now the game itself is reaching its end. So, if you like Battlefield or multiplayer shooters in general, definitely give it a try while it's still possible, especially considering how cheap it can be now (or even free with an EA subscription).",Recommended,1537,67.8 hrs on record,"Posted: June 21, 2024"

Yes, the game launched poorly, but so did 3 and 4.

Is it missing a lot of key elements that made Battlefield what Battlefield was known and loved for? Yes.
It's not nearly as immersive, heart-felt, polished or complex, but at the end of the day, it's still a fun game to pickup and play with friends.
I've met a lot of new friends, had some great laughs and shared many memorable moments on this game, and will continue to do so.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198205146616/,"I bought 2042 during the 2024 summer sale for £5. I was sceptical coming into it knowing how poorly received it was at launch but was amazingly surprised by the game and have got completely addicted to it.

They're rolling out new content regularly, have fun weekly events and game modes every week and has rewarding game play and gun play.

The guns aren't as balanced as they could be but I feel this is not unlike other battlefields but all the weapons are useable and I love the new specialist system they added.

I saw comments when buying the game saying that vehicle and long range sniper play styles are punished and I don't think this is specifically true. Sniping is still very rewarding and viable as with vehicles but its true that vehicles definitely have a shorter life span especially in games with 128 players but I have seen people survive entire games and wipe entire lobbies in helis so there's still something for the turbo virges out there

All in all I'd highly recommend, its enough of a challenge to feed competitive hunger and can be just as sweaty as bf4 and also has challenges and fun little things to do for more casual players and map sizes that allow more passive play styles to be variable. I also love the addition of CQC conquest which is small map conquest with no vehicles which can be a good change of pace when I'm getting kerosene bombed over and over.

Battlefield has some things that you can find in every title, but always with a lot of new features.

SurenMi,https://steamcommunity.com/id/SurenMi/,"When Battlefield 2042 was first announced, it promised a bold leap into the future of the franchise .. a chaotic, large-scale warzone brimming with innovative ideas like dynamic weather and massive 128-player battles. The vision was thrilling, but sadly, the execution stumbled, leaving a game that feels like a shadow of its potential.

At launch, 2042 was a diamond in the rough. The core concept had sparks of brilliance—Portal mode offered nostalgic creativity, and the sheer scale of maps felt ambitious. But these sparks were quickly dimmed by technical issues, clunky optimization, and a lack of polish. It’s as if the game was rushed out before it could fully cook, which might explain why it struggled to capture the magic of past Battlefield titles.

The biggest letdown, though, is the server experience. Most modes are ghost towns, failing to start because of low player counts. You’re often stuck with bots filling the gaps, which kills the thrill of human-driven chaos that Battlefield is known for. Only specific modes, like Conquest or Breakthrough, see real players—and even then, only during peak hours. This leaves the game feeling hollow, as if you’re wandering a battlefield that never truly comes alive.

Despite these flaws, there’s still a flicker of hope. Patches have improved things over time, and the community’s passion keeps the fight alive. If DICE can refine the experience and repopulate the servers, 2042 could yet rise from its rocky start. For now, it’s a bittersweet reminder that even the grandest ideas need care to shine.

Battlefield 2042, released by DICE, has become one of the most anticipated first-person shooter games in 2021. Despite the mixed reviews upon release, the game has improved significantly during its existence, and now it offers a lot of positive things for PC players.

Graphics and atmosphere
The graphics component of Battlefield 2042 is really impressive. Weather effects, destructibility and detailed maps create a unique atmosphere of large-scale military operations. Giant maps allow tactics to run wild, and dynamic battles involving up to 128 players provide continuous action.

Gameplay
One of the main advantages of the game is its gameplay. The introduction of new character classes has added variety to the gameplay. The perks and operatives system has also proved successful, allowing players to customize their characters to suit different game styles.

The individualization of the weapon was partially successful. Although new types of weapons sometimes displace the old ones in terms of accuracy, everyone will find something to their liking. Dynamic movement, complemented by short jerks and tackles, benefited the gameplay, making it smoother and more responsive.

Game Modes
Battlefield 2042 features a variety of modes, each offering a unique gaming experience. The classic ""Breakthrough"" mode brings players back to their favorite mass battles, and the Hazard Zone mode offers a more cooperative and strategic approach. Portal, in turn, allows you to enjoy maps from the old parts of the series with updated rules.

• PC game optimization still leaves much to be desired. Ping and server problems sometimes occur, but developers are actively working to fix them. Despite the fact that bugs and black screens are still found, the overall state of the game has improved significantly over the past two years.

• Battlefield™ 2042 is a great choice for those looking for a dynamic and diverse multiplayer shooter. Despite some problems with the release, the game has improved significantly and offers many positive aspects. If you are willing to give the game time to refine and improve, then you will get your dose of fan and enjoy all the benefits it offers.",Recommended,2584,80.3 hrs on record,"Posted: December 16, 2024"

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198011829736/,"This game was horrendous at release, but its absolutely fantastic now, along with some cons and bugs and big/obvious/necessary feature requests that have existed for years that EA has ignored for some reason.

Recently, when EA announced its next-gen Battlefield in development, they basically mentioned that 'most players dont like 128 player modes' and 'ts so challenging to make nice and detailed maps for 128 players so we want to focus on 64 player maps' (the 128 player maps are bigger). Well, sorry EA, stop making excuses for having to host more expensive 128-player servers, spend some more money to make the larger maps nicer, stop cheaping-out, hire more devs, and make the game better.

EA couldnt even deliver a working Server-Search feature which has been highly requested for years, and EA has ignored bugs in their single-player bot-match modes where vehicles spawn under the maps (been like this for years and EA doesnt care).

After becoming so accustomed to 128-player mode, which is much larger, much faster gameplay (and I love it), now whenever I drop into a 32 v 32 match (64 player mode), its noticeably slower gameplay and less places to attack from, the maps are simply shrunk down way more and you lose areas that you used to be able to visit, and flying around in helicopters and jets is insanely confined and now super frustrating. EA Games will kill Battlefield for myself and many others if they ever choose to get rid of the 128 player mode which EA also recently did without warning a few months back, but fortunately they brought back the 128-play mode within a week after having tried to kill it off.

Fortunately, the timing is great, because another Battlefield-like game (free-to-play!) is about to release on December 4 2024...Im not sure if I can mention that other game in my review, so if you simply search online for 'New Battlefield Competitor Game' I'm sure you'll find it. Competition is a good thing which will hopefully force EA/Dice to make things better, or perhaps finally throw in the towel.

Instead I tried to play various modes and personally experience this game before posting, because I don't want to waste your time with bs.

THE GOOD
This game has so much positive improvements it's close to meeting my deep rooted feelings for BF2.

The game modes are great, giving every variety of player type a version of the game that suits.

For those battle hardened franchise lovers looking for 64 player battles, there are plenty of options. And although some regions with some particular times may not suit for finding lots of players, in most games I tested there were a good number of humans to challenge my skills!

But for me the biggest win was the near instant, ease of selecting either the Conquest Solo/Co-op (very similar to BF2 flag captures) or the Breakthrough Solo/Co-op (push forward to ever moving front line targets) games.
Instantly enter the action against Bots, invite a few friends on EA to join and within about 30 seconds were were all out battling with ease and fun.

Bots can be quickly adjusted depending on the friends and their experience, and the maps are epic, in some cases enhanced version of tried but true BF3 map etc.

BF2 days rekindled. But as I said in my heart I recall fondly the BF2 skirmishes with my friends playing. With a quick EA login, setup a custom Portal experience, I create my favourite maps with my preferences for players, bot numbers, respawn timings etc. Took me about 5 minutes to setup a test Portal Custom game.

Called my friends, told them to join and we were playing my custom game in a few minutes! One friend trying to run me over with his T28 tank as I fled to my buddy picking me up in the LATV4 RECON to attack Delta1! We were back in the thick of action and BF2 style gaming with friends in matter of half an hour.


THE BAD
As mentioned earlier if you're looking for epic all-out warfare there are regions and times that some host servers just don't have many players, sometimes mostly bots and bots can suck badly especially close in combat.

At regular pricing this 2021 game cost can also be quite steep when compared to newer battle games.
But when on sale ( i got it on Christmas special for about $9 ) and then add some cool skins for money you saved otherwise the game can be quite enjoyable, especially in certain game modes with friends.

OVERALL
Overall the game options, the power of using Portal to customise your own play, and the pretty reasonable game progression/weapons improvements make this one of the best games of the franchise and frankly pretty close to my all time favourite BF2 experience!

I appreciate the hard work and several years that have gone into improving this game and recommend you try it with friends, especially if you can get it on sale!",Recommended,2379,92.1 hrs on record,"Posted: December 27, 2024"

Doomks,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Doomks/,"Battlefield 2042: A Bold but Flawed Leap into the Future

Overall Rating: ★★★★☆

In the highly anticipated ""Battlefield 2042,"" developed by DICE, players are thrust into an expansive and chaotic battlefield set in a near-future world. While the game introduces innovative elements, it grapples with certain issues that impact the overall experience.

Spectacular Scale: ★★★★☆
One of the defining features of Battlefield 2042 is its enormous maps and player count, delivering an unparalleled sense of scale. The expansive landscapes and dynamic weather systems contribute to the game's immersive environments.

Innovative Specialists: ★★★☆☆
The introduction of Specialists, each with unique abilities, adds a layer of strategy to the gameplay. However, it also brings concerns about balancing issues, as some abilities can significantly impact the flow of battles.

Technical Challenges: ★★☆☆☆
Battlefield 2042 has faced notable challenges at launch, including server issues, bugs, and performance problems. These technical shortcomings have hindered the smooth enjoyment of the game and led to frustration among players.

Visual Excellence: ★★★★☆
Visually, the game is stunning. The detailed character models, realistic environments, and impressive visual effects showcase the capabilities of modern gaming technology. However, the visual prowess is somewhat offset by technical issues on certain platforms.

Revamped Hazard Zone: ★★★☆☆
The introduction of the Hazard Zone game mode brings a fresh experience to the Battlefield series, focusing on squad-based gameplay and high-stakes objectives. While it adds variety, its execution falls short of reaching its full potential.

Dynamic Levolution: ★★★☆☆
The dynamic weather and environmental changes contribute to the evolving nature of battles, introducing an element of unpredictability. However, some players may find that the impact of these events on gameplay is not as significant as expected.

Missing Single-Player Campaign: ★★☆☆☆
Battlefield 2042 departs from the tradition of including a single-player campaign, opting for a focus on multiplayer modes. This decision has disappointed some players who enjoyed the narrative-driven experiences of previous titles.

Conclusion:
Battlefield 2042 attempts to redefine the franchise with ambitious concepts and cutting-edge visuals. While its scale, Specialists, and dynamic environments contribute to its strengths, technical issues at launch and a departure from certain franchise norms have led to a mixed reception. As the game undergoes updates and improvements, there is potential for Battlefield 2042 to evolve into a more cohesive and enjoyable experience for fans of large-scale multiplayer warfare.",Recommended,2347,57.6 hrs on record,"Posted: December 1, 2024"

Gameplay:
Now that the seasons are over, the devs offer small events from sometime, but this reduces even more the interest we might have in buying this game.
That said, the modes offered in this battlefield are really pleasant, from 8vs8 to 128vs128, which is impressive. The maps are very nice, but unfortunately there aren't very many of them.
The Breakthrough, Rush and Conquest modes are the most popular, but you can also find a few players for co-op.
Even if the seasons are finally over, the gameplay is interesting enough to play this game, but I wouldn't recommend buying it today.

Graphic design:
It's very beautiful and very successful, the maps are beautiful and sometimes very large for battles at 128vs128 without bug or lag and with download times respectable the devs have done a good job and its not a surprise.

The actual base bf2042? Trash. Boring gunplay, miserable operator abilities that muck up the map flow and design, giant bland maps with nothing to do but run and die. No interesting mechanics, aside from the godawful operator abilities. This game is literally ""Generic Shooter"" fresh from the slop tube. Rife with small bugs even almost FOUR YEARS after launch. The game was launched broken and lifeless, and you can still feel it today.

The legacy content? Good as hell. It actually feels like some folks put in a lot of effort to make it feel like an older Battlefield, despite the newer engine, maps, and mechanics. Specifically the BF3 servers, it is night and day. Simple changes in how weapons and classes are balanced make the game feel so, so much better that it is actually comical when you go back to the 2042 exclusive servers, where the gunplay sucks cuz they all feel the same, your class doesn't matter even slightly, and your operator abilities are ridiculous and generally OP or completely unfun to play with.

That outta the way, lemme remind you that THIS REVIEW IS POSITIVE BECAUSE I PAID $3 FOR THE GAME. This game would probably be the worst battlefield if I'd paid full price for it. IF you are kinda curious like I was, buy it when it is on sale. Any price above like, $15 for this experience renders it an absolute insult to battlefield fans and consumers on the whole.

pazantine,https://steamcommunity.com/id/pazantine/,"I like this game and I'm tired of pretending I don't.

Does it do things that are objectively downgrades from prior Battlefield games? Yes.

Does the specialist system kind of suck and was it really only added as an excuse to sell more micro transactions? Also yes.

Do a lot of maps, even post rework, suffer from too much objective separation and laughably low amounts of cover in bare empty terrain? Triple yes.

Was Portal a complete missed opportunity? ...do I need to answer that for you?

All this being said though, I am in firm belief there is no such thing as a bad mainline BF game. The worst they get is ""just okay"", unlike modern day Call of Duty which does everything in its power to be as hostile and disrespectful to your time and money as they can legally get away with. 2042 is not a saint in this regard either, but it's than the former.

It's big, dumb, large scale warfare with fun gadgets, equipment, guns and vehicles to mess around with. Battlefield has been more visually impressive, more mechanically complex, and has had a stronger sense of identity than this game - but it's still fun, and I think that's what most of us are here for at the end of the day.

Goes on sale for dirt cheap constantly so even if you don't like it, you won't be taking all that significant of a hit financially.

GreyNadeOfficial,https://steamcommunity.com/id/GreyNadeOfficial/,"So i saw a lot of reviews of this game being trash.
But at current stage the game has pretty much fixed all the bugs.
The maps are totally different looking and worth playing compared to what it was at launch.

Players aren't tryhards so its fun I'd say.
only thing is you won't find many players in this game.

Frontline mode and all are really fun to play as it needs lesser players compared to other game modes.
And flying jets and heli is also fun

At current price of 5$ or 299inr BF2042 is definitely worth it. (refund if you don't like it anyways)

BF 2042? It's a bit of a strange beast, but it’s grown on me like a scar that somehow makes you look cooler.

What I rate hard:

Bots, bots, bots – Thank the gaming gods I can load up Conquest or Breakthrough with a full server of bots and pretend it’s 2007. No toxic teammates screaming slurs, no campers, just me vs. the AI – and they’re not complete potatoes either. It’s like therapy after a rough day.

Graphics are sexy af – Some of the close-quarters maps are straight eye candy. That crisp, gritty detail paired with some nice lighting makes the firefights feel intense, especially in solo sessions.

Portal is a mad idea... – It gives major throwback vibes. Setting up old-school rules, tweaking damage and weapons, mixing eras – it’s a dream for creative players. But ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥, why is it so restrictive? If I want to make a 2-shot hardcore mode with XP and ribbons, let me live, DICE.

Solo content actually exists – Unlike most shooters today that shove multiplayer down your throat, 2042 lets you go full lone wolf. With a weak player base in my area, that’s a huge win.

What kinda bugs me:

Bullet sponge nonsense – I don’t know what these bots are made of, but eating 5+ 30mm cannon shots should turn anyone into salsa, not just make them flinch. Hit reg and damage needs a good ol’ tuning fork.

Lore with no legs – They built this whole world of ""No-Pats"" vs. the powers that be, but in the actual game? It’s just “No-Pat vs No-Pat” chaos. You spawn on a team with no real identity and it kills immersion. Feels like a missed opportunity for something deeper.

Rough start, solid recovery – Credit where it’s due, the devs really patched this thing up from the steaming mess it was at launch. It’s more stable now, and most of the bugs are dead or dying.

Bottom Line: If you’re looking for a chilled yet chaotic shooter with bot support, slick visuals, and a bit of nostalgia – Battlefield 2042 is absolutely worth it. But if you're hunting for a tight, lore-driven multiplayer experience with satisfying damage and freedom in custom servers, you're gonna feel a bit boxed in. Still, I’ve put in enough hours to say: it’s flawed, but I ♥♥♥♥♥♥’ enjoy it.",Recommended,1899,168.9 hrs on record,Posted: April 18

Omegacon55,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Omegacon55/,"The Bad: Before I even got in the game I was mad at the EA launcher. Thought we figured out 10 years ago nobody likes operators instead of classes. Most people are playing like its Cod with double sprint and sliding and jumping. Guns have infinite range its just a matter of controlling recoil, this adds to people playing like its cod.
Not necessarily bad but something I'm starting to hate is all the hud lights, I don't need or want to see a blue light above every friendly and a red one above every enemy, its ridiculous that ill try to hide and camouflage and they'll see some stupid red dot that clearly wouldn't exist and can kill me before I even realize whats happening.

The Good: Lots of weapons, gadgets and attachments, change attachments on the fly for different situations, every class/op can use any weapon. (cool but kinda ruins the need for a class/op no?) Alot of the gadgets and weapons can be unlocked early by doing challenges so no level grind for the most part. Not a flyer so cant speak on that but tanks have a significantly reduced ttk compared to other games which is nice if you're infantry but not nice if your a tanker I guess.

All in all the good is larger than the bad and you can ""Control"" some of the bad such as people playing like its cod if you slow your pace down by being a sniper or marksman and sneaking around its quite fun but as soon as you play one of the smaller maps such as the Norwegian factory one or the beached tanker one you'll want to quit unless you go to the darkside and also play like its cod but i don't know about you but I play this because its supposed to be significantly slower more tactical and therefore less stress and concentration, I just want to play a game and have fun doing it.

• Battlefield 3

• Battlefield: Bad Company 2

Everyone would ask, where is BF4 but my reason would be that I don't really like the meta of that game and stupid amount of gadgets/attachments. I don't mind the class system being replaced with operators. I support that some games aren't afraid to experiment with features that no one expects. I love how the progression system with this game, how everything can be unlocked by doing simple missions without grinding for 100 hours straight. I still don't support the microtransactions being in this game and I will never buy skins when you can just spend your money on buying different actual game.

DEELTz,https://steamcommunity.com/id/DEELTz/,"Battlefield 2042 Review – 16 Hours In

Rating: ⭐⭐⭐⭐☆ (4/5)

After 16 hours in Battlefield 2042, I can confidently say this game is a thrilling mix of chaotic large-scale battles and intense, action-packed moments. It's not without its quirks, but it’s definitely living up to its name in many ways.



The scale of combat is impressive, with huge maps that allow for unpredictable and intense skirmishes. The new specialist system adds a unique twist to classic roles, giving more ways to approach objectives and adapt to different combat situations. Whether I'm sniping from afar, storming an objective, or diving into chaos with a tank, every match feels like a new experience.



Visually, is a stunner. The environments are sprawling, detailed, and brought to life with dynamic weather effects that impact gameplay. Hearing thunder rumbling in the distance and watching a tornado roll across the battlefield is exhilarating. Audio is also top-notch, with each weapon and explosion sounding just right.



Performance has been decent overall, though there are occasional frame drops and bugs here and there. Nothing game-breaking so far, but hopefully, future patches will smooth out these rough edges. It can feel slightly chaotic with so many players and vehicles around, but that’s part of the Battlefield charm.



brings the chaos and intensity Battlefield fans love, with a fresh twist through dynamic maps and specialist roles. There’s a lot to love here, and with future updates, it could easily become a top-tier entry in the series. For now, it’s an exhilarating experience that feels worth diving into.

The game is still fun for a good few hours, plus something to grind on while you wait for another game worth your time to come out.

Plus, due to the steam summer sale (as of now) its a million times worth it, theres enough maps and old maps from previous battlefields and unlocks and weapons to keep you busy for a good few hundred hours.

Its not the greatest, nor am I saying this should be the standard or the best possible battlefield, however, if you was in the mood or itching for more battlefield fun or something to grind with the feeling of the games and weapon feeling too, then pick it up now while its still incredibly cheap, its 100 percent worth the time just by this price alone.

yernemm,https://steamcommunity.com/id/yernemm/,"1. Activate the Yeast: In a large mixing bowl, combine the warm water and sugar. Sprinkle the yeast over the water and let it sit for 5-10 minutes until it turns frothy.

2. Mix the Dough: Add the olive oil and salt to the yeast mixture. Gradually add 450 g of flour while stirring with a wooden spoon until the dough starts to come together.

3. Knead the Dough: Transfer the dough to a floured surface. Knead for 8-10 minutes, adding more flour if needed, until the dough is smooth and elastic. It should be soft but not sticky.

4. First Rise: Shape the dough into a ball and place it in a lightly oiled bowl. Turn it to coat with oil. Cover with a damp cloth or cling film. Leave in a warm place for 1-1 ½ hours until doubled in size.

5. Punch Down and Divide: Punch down the dough to release air. Place it on a floured surface and divide into 2-3 portions for your desired pizza sizes.

6. Shape the Dough: Roll out each portion into a circle or desired shape using your hands or a rolling pin.

7. Second Rise (Optional): Let the shaped dough rest for 10-15 minutes to make it easier to handle and top.

8. Preheat the Oven: Preheat your oven to 240°C and place a pizza stone or baking tray inside to heat up.

9. Add Toppings and Bake: Add sauce and your favourite toppings. Carefully slide the pizza onto the hot stone or tray. Bake for 10-12 minutes or until the crust is golden and the cheese is bubbling.

Only downside are the appearance of soldiers, I'd prefer having generic soldiers that could be customized a little, like all battlefields had before.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198053507496/,"Battlefield 2042 is a divisive topic for both long-time fans of the series, and for those on the outside looking in. The open tests and subsequent launch of the game were plagued by severe technical issues, a lack of content & polish, and a perceived 'perversion' of mechanics deemed integral to the core Battlefield experience. Despite that, rather than being left to rot, DICE has been slowly healing the game, allowing the small but dedicated community to thrive. I'll preface everything by saying that I am die-hard supporter of the franchise, and I have played extensive amounts of nearly every single Battlefield title- and for me personally, 2042 ranks alongside BF4 and BF1 at the very top of that list.

TL;DR - BF2042 is in a much better place than it was before thanks to a few years of steady content updates. It's a genuinely great Battlefield experience, with many innovative mechanics I hope are carried forward to future franchise entries.

↓↓↓ - Expanded discussion on a few points of pain.

1 - Criticism was levelled at the decision to substitute faceless soldiers for named Specialists, and dispensing with the four Class system of previous games. While I understand & share the trepidation at the label 'hero shooter', it was nowhere near as constrictive as that label typically implies. All Specialists were fully capable of utilising any and all gadgets and gear in the game- a change that was oddly disliked, and thus was rectified later in the game's lifespan; Specialists were divided into the four traditional Classes once again, with restrictions on what gear they were allowed to bring (aside from primary/secondary weapons).

2 - There was a definite drought of interactive content when the game first released; fewer weapons, maps, vehicles, gadgets, etc. I've seen arguments against the game that still use this rhetoric, unaware of the fact that 2042 now boasts a comparable amount of weapons and maps to any other entry- technically exceeding them, even- through the Portal game mode, which contains remastered maps and weapons from numerous previous games, all the way back to Battlefield 1942.

3 - The perennial issue of the modern gaming age is, for many people, the (often forced) implementation of micro-transactions and battlepasses. 2042 is certainly complicit in perpetuating this, but I believe you would be hard-pressed to find a frequently updated, PvP-centric multiplayer title that doesn't have some form of MTX or event pass system. That's not to say I condone it; I simply don't believe it's the cancer that some folks make it out to be, when the offerings are strictly cosmetic and entirely optional, which is the case for 2042. New weapons are introduced in the battlepass, yes, but they are on the free track to be earned by anyone- and if you miss out on a previous season's new gear items, you can simply earn them via assignments.

4 - The removal of the single-player campaign is perhaps the topic that disappoints me the most. This one stings. I always enjoyed playing through the campaigns of Battlefield and Call of Duty games, but always preferred the former. I even actually found myself in the minority of people who were happy with BF1's shift to War Stories- it allowed for the telling of many self-contained stories, with drastically different characters & settings (which I personally found to have much more replay value than the traditional long form campaigns of earlier titles). EA was unfortunately too concerned with transforming Battlefield into another Apex Legends (EA placing potential profits above making a good game or listening to fans? Shocker!), and DICE could likely do nothing but conform.

Battlefield 2042 is yet another example of the benefits to being prudent in the judgement of new games, *especially* AAA games; sadly, it seems to be the modern standard to release games in an unfinished state, and patching them up over time into something worth playing. That doesn't always happen- sometimes failed games are shot in the leg and left to die, with everything they could have been slowly bleeding out into the dirt. 2042 avoided this fate; it stumbled at first, but eventually it hit a steady stride and crossed the finish line. Even then, its reputation will likely never recover, and after the current season ends, it'll never have the chance again. If you've heard bad things but wanted to verify for yourself, or you played it a long time ago and haven't touched it since, I urge you to give it one last try. It won't be around for too much longer, and I for one think that's a damn shame.",Recommended,3821,146.5 hrs on record,"Posted: July 3, 2024"

As a Battlefield game, 2042 is a good experience overall. The heroes don't really do anything for me but the class/gadget setup is generally fun and I do like swapping between deployable turrets, FPV missiles, and the like. You can have a lot of fun with these gadgets. Sounds, visuals, and so forth are all at typical triple A levels though 2042 doesn't really push the genre forward at all either.

The worse game thought out whole serial

Intro
personal I played battlefields 1 and 4 before, 1 are true master piece which I played for over 200 hours it's so fun, 4 had huge sever issue I say it kind of chaos, 1 own the best sever which so far.



don't be fool by developer the fact are every in games match are messy and there are zero percentage of ""team work"" in this game, it's just 64 or 128 COD players running around the whole map, everyone are run and gun.

the game in medic is like pure trash to play with, everyone could revived too and medic didn't revived fast compare to other class, I thought developers just delete this class it won't made any different.



2042 weapons system are really weird, seem all gun could switch out with all class except the sniper which use only by recon, smg are really hard because the lower range, most player using the machine gun or marksman seem the only decent gun in game, the whole gun pool are too tiny, it's already published since 2019 this game still struggled to the gun selection which player still limit to small choice of the guns.

For the hacker issue in game it's out of control you gonna see like 100 snipe kills this kind of aim bot or lock blood undead Rambo killed every other then full hp back to the base.

The sever are potato like, every match is full with lag spike and freeze issue, every times you aim on sight would cause small freeze, you could even shoot out whole magazine and found all miss even when enemy just stand two feet away you.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198269490855/,"I've been playing Battlefield since the second one released way back in the early-mid 2000s. So, I think I have a pretty good grasp on what a good or bad Battlefield game is. Battlefield 2042 is definitely not the strongest title to date but it sure isn't the worst. I do believe the gun play mechanics are a step back from the BFV/BF1 mechanics but they still feel good for what they are.

The maps are probably some of the most forgettable and bland ones to date. BF3 you had iconic maps like operation metro and BF4 you had operation locker and Shanghai. BF2042 has none that I can remember like that and that's not the only negative the title has going for it.

The game launch was bare and clunky but so was BF4s if anyone remembers the server issues and gameplay bugs. But we saw how well it came to be once it was updated and supported. Well, in recent years with bad launches like this game and BFV it seems EA updates it to a point where its better than ever and just needs more content before cutting support which is a shame as BFV and 2042 are now playable and enjoyable games but content support was cut before they could really reach the potential these games had.

Now is BF2042 worth getting in 2024? I think on sale for 6.99 it definitely is but not for full price considering rumor is the next entry into the franchise is supposedly coming out next year.",Recommended,1119,17.7 hrs on record,"Posted: June 30, 2024"

However, this game should be called ""Just Cause: Online"", rather than BF. If You want real Battlefield Experience, go try previous chapter like BF1, or even better Squad. There are many advantages like lots of weapons, NO ""pay-to-unlock"" maps or guns, vehicles, etc. As main drawback is, sometimes online drops significantly and You play with bots, against bots, so You have to change server. But there is no such issue on weekend.

Rating: 7/10

Pros:

Stunning Visuals and Immersive Sound Design
Battlefield 2042 excels in delivering breathtaking graphics and audio. The massive maps feel alive, with weather effects like tornadoes and sandstorms adding a thrilling dynamic. The sound design is top-notch, capturing the intensity of war with booming explosions and realistic weapon effects.

Massive Battles with Scale and Chaos
With matches supporting up to 128 players on next-gen platforms and PC, Battlefield 2042 successfully conveys the chaos of all-out warfare. The maps are diverse, ranging from urban centers to wide-open deserts, offering varied gameplay experiences.

Specialist System
The introduction of Specialists adds a new layer of strategy. Each Specialist has unique abilities and gadgets, allowing players to tailor their gameplay style and contribute more dynamically to their squad.

Environmental Hazards and Dynamic Events
The inclusion of extreme weather and interactive events, like rockets launching mid-game, enhances the unpredictability of matches and keeps the experience fresh.

Cons:

Limited Content at Launch
Battlefield 2042 launched with fewer maps and modes compared to previous titles. While the existing content is engaging, the lack of variety can make the game feel repetitive over time.

Performance Issues and Bugs
Despite patches, Battlefield 2042 still struggles with bugs and performance inconsistencies. Players on all platforms have reported glitches, crashes, and hit-registration issues that hinder the overall experience.

Specialist System Controversy
While innovative, the Specialist system received criticism from long-time fans who preferred the traditional class system. It sometimes makes teamwork feel less cohesive, as players may focus more on individual playstyles than squad objectives.

Lack of Key Features
Features such as a comprehensive scoreboard, voice chat at launch, and community-requested updates were missing, leaving the game feeling incomplete. Although updates have improved these aspects, the initial absence frustrated many players.

Conclusion:
Battlefield 2042 is an ambitious entry in the franchise, offering expansive maps, large-scale battles, and dynamic weather systems that deliver memorable moments. However, its rocky launch, performance issues, and divisive changes to core gameplay mechanics have overshadowed its potential. While subsequent updates have addressed some concerns, Battlefield 2042 remains a game that feels like it’s still finding its footing. For die-hard Battlefield fans, it’s worth exploring—but it might not fully satisfy those looking for a polished experience from day one.

Recommendation: Wait for sales or further updates unless you're eager to jump into its massive multiplayer chaos.",Recommended,2428,5.3 hrs on record,Posted: January 3

cuddlygamergirlnumber4498,https://steamcommunity.com/id/cuddlygamergirlnumber4498/,"The shooter part of this is great, Infantry Vs Infantry is very good imo but the Battlefield aspect kind of sucks. I rarely see medics or support actually doing their job, where in older titles teamwork is more important and good players will prioritise doing their class role. Conquest is still dominated by vehicles sadly, feels like you're either 1: in a vehicle making an impact 2: playing engineer destroying vehicles or 3: dying repeatedly to something you couldn't deal with since C4 in this game is abysmal compared to previous titles.
If you want a classic Battlefield experience, go play BF2 or BF4, if you want something new and flashy, this game on sale is a decent choice. Sure it's still buggy asf and the ""micro""transactions are pretty bad and greedy and the progression is just lazy and boring and sometimes unfun. example: to unlock the desert eagle you must first unlock the M44 Revolver then get 90 kills with it to UNLOCK armour piercing rounds, then you must destroy a vehicle using it... so specific and obnoxious it took me like 6 hours WITH using bot servers to unlock AP.
In short, the bad is the poor progression, high-end specs demand, vehicle camping and lack of teamwork.
The good however, oh my god it outweighs the negatives for me, the gunplay is responsive and smooth the movement is deep and can result in some extreme outplays even against aim training gods and the in-game attachment switch is honestly just amazing. Want to run in like an idiot with an M5? switch to a CQC setup and get a better chance, want to snipe with an smg? go ahead! I love it.
If you look past the negatives, this game is great, I'd say the older Battlefields are kinda better but they are more toxic, on this game the majority of players are just kinda doing their own thing.

typinets,https://steamcommunity.com/id/typinets/,"All ppl write bad reviews on this game cuz its a trend and they have no opinion of their own. I write it because to play for 5 minutes u have to spend an hour looking for ♥♥♥♥ but its the same for each battlefield after fourth one. As well as it crashes quite a lot, imagine constantly connecting to lobbies waiting 5 minutes per each loading screen (ssd speed is like a few gigabytes literally) to see [waiting for players 3/64]... And yes amounts of ads on all of their like battle passes makes it feel like im playing war face rather then an AAA project. Speaking of battle pass, this battlefield invented something new in the series, and that is the only available button in some loading screen being the gahdaamn battle pass. They like telling me, the player, that they r capable of placing for example an options menu there so i change ♥♥♥♥ or customize classes for instance but no, only thing they will place is battle pass. Previous battlefields such as battlefield ""1"" r unplayable as well and share most minuses, such as empty lobbies, very long loading times just to see that very empty lobby.

Sometimes when i connect to lobby and it instantly end (90% of all lobbies) when i wait till match restarts i just see literally black screen and nothing else and it sometimes even crashes

After reviving allies near ladder as medic camera snaps to like normal view (u obviously watch down before) and then it locks so for ever and u cannot use mouse.

And yet i must mention that they done a great work on internet traffic. For instance in cs2 i can barely play, my shots r not registered by the server as well as many inputs, im constantly getting teleported n stuff, as well as in many other games such as gmod which is unplayable as well because of how poorly the server-client connection r written, so they lag even tho they barely have anything to track, in cs, for instance, its just 10 players and a few additional entities of which many r static and other half has no variables but transform. But battlefield games on the other hand has 128 players to track, each of which has a ton of variables to synchronize, as well as at least dozen of vehicles, and hundreds of other entities such as various projectiles, destructible stuff, doors, events, triggers. And yet this game works completely fine for me and registers each of my shot and input, yes i must admit that sometimes it has some flaws like im getting stuck in fences, and yet it doesnt freaking snap me around the whole map like it happens in valve games, it like handles it much more smooth and it happens really rarely.

today while playing at complete sudden moment while i was running my screen just turnt black, i mean only battlefield and all sounds suddenly stoped n stuff so it counts as crash

U can create ur own custom server and in difference from 90% of other games ur friends actually can join. But its usless since u cannot pick team even tho its ur own lobby.

Some achievenemts gettin unlocked randomly for no reason, for instance i just got a notification for grapping hook achievement, even tho i play only as medic and i dont have any hook",Recommended,2569,34.7 hrs on record,"Posted: November 9, 2024"

Kane666,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Kane666/,"Actually playing against AI is more battlefield than PVP where everyone plays for K/D. I enjoyed my time a lot more with AI, than getting spawn killed from sweaty snipers on a very bad map design. Also The problem I've had with Battlefield for a long time is the player's ignorance of dropping ammo, or repairing techniques. I drive a damaged tank past the engineer and guess what and I'm not even talking about the problem with ammunition, nobody plays support class to drop ammo. On the other hand, a lot of people play medic, as it is already a classic, players drop like pears and walking around and just spamming the left button will get you to the top of the scoreboard by just reviving.... Well who played METRO can tell, LOL. Even the reviving is much more difficult now, you need to take a time to revive someone, it´s still a thing.

While AI, if I want it, will fix my technique, if I want Ammo and support is nearby, it will drop ammo or even revive me when medic nearby, it is played on manning and on objectives, which in PVP is pure Call of duty gameplay.
But TBH I bought it mainly for the tornado and changing weather during the game, which was last in battlefield 4 and I was missing it a lot, and it's adds a lot on atmosphere when a devastating tornado starts crushing your screen from behind or sandstorm darkens your vision.
Also you can level up by playing against AI and unlock your gear. So If you don´t want to run over bad designed maps for snipers just with basic guns with no attachments, I would recommend start with AI and get unlocks there first.


Yes I enjoyed my time against AI, That's probably the only reason to buy this game, you can also play that in a COOP up to 4 players.",Recommended,1397,22.3 hrs on record,"Posted: November 6, 2024"
7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198804197703/,"Alright, let's talk Battlefield 2042. Now, before you close this tab to watch your 78th montage of glitches from last year, just pause. Battlefield 2042 has come a long way since those infamous launch days when a helicopter could take down your whole squad through a wall... while in the menus. Let me tell you, folks, we’re in a different universe now. A better one. A (mostly) functional one!

If you’re someone who's been hanging out in free-to-play FPS games, thinking, ""Hey, I’d like something that feels like a blockbuster movie but with three times the chaos of Warzone,"" welcome home. Battlefield 2042 is like every Michael Bay movie but with slightly fewer explosions… and better graphics. You’ve got tornadoes! You've got 128 players frantically blowing up everything in sight! You’ve got tanks launching themselves off of cliffs like they're auditioning for Fast and Furious 17! It’s beautiful.

First things first: Battlefield 2042 has been polished up nicely. They must’ve hired some wizard coders because there are now actual working hitboxes and visible enemies, which is a step up. The bugs that made you question if your graphics card was crying for help? They’re (mostly) gone. The HUD won’t block half your view like it’s trying to be the MVP. You can finally run through buildings without suddenly ending up in a purgatorial void!

As a free-to-play FPS veteran, you'll feel like you’re stepping into a whole new world of legit battlefield chaos here. Yes, it’s chaotic, but it’s that beautiful “I can’t believe I just drove an ATV into a jet while parachuting from a skyscraper” kind of chaos. And let’s be real, isn’t that what we all want?

The Specialist system might get flak from Battlefield purists, but if you're coming from a game where ""character personality"" equals having a different-colored camo pattern, you’re going to feel spoiled. They each have unique skills that might make you wonder why you ever needed actual teammates in the first place. Self-healing? Check. Insane grappling hook maneuvers that make Spiderman look like a noob? Oh, yeah. If your dream was to zipline over tanks while calling down an airdrop on the enemy’s last stand, this is your game.

And if you’re worried about team play? Don't be! Nobody really works as a team here either, so you’ll fit right in. Sure, you might get revived once every hundred matches, but that’s just Battlefield’s way of toughening you up.

Alright, let’s talk visuals. If your last FPS game looked like a potato wearing sunglasses, brace yourself. Battlefield 2042 looks incredible. With all the dust storms, explosive debris, and the occasional tornado picking up tanks like it’s playing with Hot Wheels, this game is the next level of pretty. You’ll find yourself staring at that sunset as rockets whiz by, pondering your next respawn with the grace of a poet.

And the sound design? Let’s just say you’ll know when a tank is rolling up behind you, because it sounds like it’s hungry and you’re the snack. The gun sounds are so crisp, you’ll almost forget you missed your shot because you were marveling at it.

These maps are massive. You thought Verdansk was big? Battlefield 2042’s maps are like a small country where everyone has unlimited ammo and no regard for their own survival. Breakthrough mode lets you live your best action hero life, charging objectives while explosions rain down like confetti at a birthday party for adrenaline junkies. Or try Conquest, where you’ll spend half your time trying to figure out which way is north but the other half marveling at the sheer scale of destruction.

Forget the angry reviews from last year. Battlefield 2042 has evolved. For FPS fans looking to step up from free-to-play, this game offers something new: unfiltered, chaotic, heart-pounding mayhem, minus the bargain bin textures and questionable physics. Now, is it perfect? No, because perfection is overrated, and where’s the fun in everything working like it should? But it’s definitely fun, and it’s definitely worth another try.

So, if you’re ready to leave behind the tiny maps, predictable spawns, and camping corners of your free-to-play FPS and dive into something epic, grab Battlefield 2042 and join the madness. And remember – when in doubt, throw a grenade. Or twelve.",Recommended,3578,39.3 hrs on record,"Posted: November 5, 2024"

I don't like the operators. They don't fit the game at all - playing as a ""Generic soldier"" instead of some person with distinct style, voice and annoying comments would be more immersive. Some maps are asymmetric - it's usually harder to defend on a certain side.

Bud despite all that, I'm having a lot of fun! There are still those moments when I revive someone and we become ""friends"". Some operators have pretty cool synergies which create interesting new ways to play together. Every now and then new time-limited game mode will be added, and while a match starts with bots, new players will quickly join in, the game not dead yet. Developers still release balancing patches.

I'm running a 4600 with settings: 1440P with Balanced DLSS and getting around 140 FPS. Rivertuner and Nvidia FPS counters appear to be blocked when running this game so I had to use my TV's game center to check FPS in order to optimize the game for optimal performance. The EA app installed immediately when starting the game, and it didn't ask me to sign in, probably because EA is a virus that knows all your information. I bought this game on sale just like on Xbox because EA games aren't worth full price.",Recommended,470,117.6 hrs on record,"Posted: September 21, 2024"
