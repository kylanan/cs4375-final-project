purplealligator,https://steamcommunity.com/id/purplealligator/,"Our son was only 14 when he was diagnosed with Lukemia. The journey was long, filled with treatments, surgeries, and countless nights where we watched him battle not just the disease, but the overwhelming fear and loneliness that came with it.

But there was one thing that brought him back to life in those dark moments: The Binding of Isaac.

He found it during one of his hospital stays, and at first, it was just something to pass the time. But soon, it became more. As he played, he would tell us about his runs—how his items worked together, how he fought back against impossible odds. We saw him light up with excitement, a spark of joy we hadn’t seen in a long time. The game gave him a sense of purpose, a chance to be a hero, even when he couldn’t be one in his own life. For hours, he’d immerse himself in that world, and for a while, the pain seemed to fade.

Sadly, he lost his battle. But those moments, those hours spent with Isaac, were some of the happiest of his final months. We know that, for him, it wasn’t just a game. It was a source of strength. A way to feel like he was in control when so much of his life had been taken from him.

To the creators of The Binding of Isaac: Thank you. You gave our son a little piece of light when everything else felt so heavy. You gave him a way to feel like he could fight back, and for that, we are forever grateful.",Recommended,1116,756.8 hrs on record,"Posted: 10 December, 2024"

wilsoniscool1o,https://steamcommunity.com/id/wilsoniscool1o/,"To say The Binding of Isaac hasn't been a big part of my life would be an enormous understatement.
At the time of writing this I have achieved Dead God with 970 hours on steam and I promised myself that I would write a review of how impactful it was to me. No matter how unorganized it may be. I found out about Isaac from two Youtubers. Northenlion and Bisnap. I watched Northenlion for Super Meat Boy and Bisnap for Spelunkey. None of their playlist compared to the number of episodes they made for the Original Binding of Isaac. I was HOOKED. The game's art style was infections that a young me would draw the characters on sticky notes to make them stand up, I didn't stop there In 6-8th grade I'd draw them next to the notes I'd write for Social Studies, Science, and Language Arts. I bought Rebirth according to steam on:Jan 31, 2015 and also bought Isaac on the PS-Vita, My Phone,and Nintendo Switch. I played the HECK outta rebirth it is a major upgrade from flash. I'd download mods so I could reskin them beacuse I had no idea how to extract the sprites from the game nor did I know that was even a thing at the time. I only had ms paint so when I did reskin them they would always have a white background which lead me down to finding paint-dot-net a program that I still use to this very day! Anyway I think that's all I wanted to say about Isaac that I can think about on the top of my head. Lastly I'd like to thank Edmund and his team over at Nicalis!

Wolfguarde,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Wolfguarde/,"This is a forever game. By which I mean - you're going to play it heaps when you first get it, but you're going to keep coming back to it afterwards. It's a great time waster, gap filler between game releases, and generally fun arcade-style roguelike package. Playthroughs are short, but diverse in terms of build potential and consequent play experience. Bad runs can be flipped on their head depending on a single room/item, and the game has plenty of secrets to rat out for those who don't like using guides.

Overall, TBoI is one of the best-put-together games I've ever seen in terms of scope, gameplay, and overall experience. It does exactly what it was made to do, does it well, and does it in a way that doesn't get stale.",Recommended,601,486.9 hrs on record,"Posted: September 5, 2024"
7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199076429253/,"All information based on Repentance (the best way to play the game) after getting all achievements.

After playing this game to completion, it only felt right to review it. The Binding of Isaac is easily one of the best games in the rogue genre (I don’t care if it’s a -like or a -lite). No other game has made me cheer in victory, cry laughing, and groan in anger on such a frequent and regular basis. The main draw of this game is the gameplay (no doubt). There certainly is a story that you can slowly reach the core of as you play through the various routes each run can offer, and while I do enjoy it a whole lot, it should by no means be the thing that inspires you to play the game. Below are some nicely labelled sections about different gameplay elements. I’ll try to keep things as devoid of context as possible, since discovering niche mechanics or interactions is best done organically.

Characters:
The game starts with just Isaac to play as, allowing for an open yet controlled period of exploration. Soon enough you’ll unlock a handful of other characters and be able to explore their unique traits. Each character encourages a different style of play, from simple high-damage/low-health archetypes, to focusing the build on a specific type of item. Some characters are naturally strong, while others require time and a good few deaths to understand (the latter of which I found much more rewarding to play). The game never feels as if it’s overwhelming you with character choice, as the roster is filled out at a steady pace while you progress through the game’s routes and defeat new bosses. While I would not say that there are any unfun characters, some are certainly less fun. To keep it brief; a set of twins and a man who can’t make his mind up have caused me some slight anguish. Through fulfilling certain criteria and/or beating set challenges, there are a slew of permanent upgrades certain characters can receive. While I do wish some of these had a bigger impact on how the character plays, they are largely interesting and enhance the relevant character.
It's fascinating what you can find in your own home.

Items:
This game has a lot of items, over 700 by the time everything is unlocked. Some items give standard boosts to health or damage, while others radically alter how you play. Simply pick something up and see what it does; Some extra range? Homing projectiles? An infinite stock of bombs? Everything is part of the learning experience and even a mix of shoddy items can show you something new. Each item also has its own wonderfully depicted sprite, which is invaluable when you recognise an item you enjoyed previously, or indeed, one you did not. Even the most simplistic of runs will still net you around 8 items to play with, and that number will only increase the more you learn and improve. Almost everything you do with a character will unlock more items for you to find, expanding the game in a way that is proportionate to your experience and skill.
Looking between the walls is far more rewarding than it is in real life.

Enemies and Bosses:
Every dungeon has its monsters, and in this game that means every area hosts its own assortment of horrors. Enemies are widely varied in design, attacks, movement patterns and sounds. Every room will mix enemies in a way that tests your movement and understanding of your items. All encounters test and build upon your ability to prioritise threats and move effectively around projectiles and obstacles. Your experiences culminate in the many boss fights each run provides. Bosses can range from ‘that enemy you saw earlier is bigger now’ to completely unique encounters. Each floor hosts its own pool of bosses, keeping each run fresh and making you consistently apply your skills. Every run will end with a battle against an End Boss. These are, naturally, some of the hardest encounters in the game and are literally the culmination of not only your current run, but every run before it. Each End Boss is unique in design and attacks, and always feel satisfying to beat, whether that’s through a tense whittling down of their health or complete obliteration.
Things aren’t always as you remember.

Art:
Every item, character, enemy, boss, environmental piece, attack, room, and door is rendered in some of the best and most consistent pixel art I’ve seen. I wouldn’t say that the art is the reason to buy the game, but it’s incredible how distinct and clear every element of the game is.

A few more things:
Want to alter the game somehow? Download a mod, there’ll (most likely) be one that does what you want.
Stupid stuff you can do:
- Drink soy and almond milk
- Eat playdough
- Fill a room with faeces (helpful more often than you might think)
- Assemble the corpse of your pet cat
- Blow yourself up (in many fun and exciting ways)
- Heal by setting off a grenade in your face
- Pee on the floor (this will save a run at some point)
- Sneeze (for crit damage)
- Make the game ‘Pay-to-Win’
- Put worms in your brain
- Get cancer (in two unique ways)
- Mandatory self-damage boomerang bombs
- Fake items
- Pay off angry debt collector
- Clip out of bounds because you’re too small
- Clip out of bounds because you can’t count to 13
- Donate blood
- Open your eyes and see

The Binding of Isaac is a true feat in game design and should be played by anyone who somewhat knows what a rogue game is. It is a game that teaches you to appreciate what you have, face your fears, persevere in the face of danger, and that hardships can be overcome. It is entirely possible that you won’t have the same experience I did playing this game, but (in a funny sort of way), maybe that’s how it’s supposed to be.",Recommended,4710,387.0 hrs on record,"Posted: October 10, 2024"

PlacentaSalad,https://steamcommunity.com/id/PlacentaSalad/,"This was easily one of the best games of its decade, now finally updated to include a proper cooperative mode, although it has its flaws what with input delay between players but hopefully that will be improved. But The Binding of Isaac was yet another indie title which proved that, sometimes, these passionate developers are serious about delivering awesome experiences that can be unmatched by AAA studios. It's amazing what indie developers can accomplish sometimes despite their low budgets and when not being pestered by upper managers and deadlines to meet the expectations of shareholders. Something that should never have mixed with video game design to the extreme that it has.

I've never played a game with more replay value than this one. It has so much content between dungeons to explore, enemies to fight, bosses to conquer, and combat to master. It's perhaps one of the greatest examples of a proper roguelike video game, where each run is different and unique and completely randomized where you never know what the layout of the maps will be, where the secret walls are going to be, which items you might get and whether they will synchronize well together, etc. You could sometimes get lucky and find yourself being rewarded with rather OP items from the very beginning that will help you finally beat the game, or the chaos of the RNG element may give you more than a few crappy items and so you just have to press forward to see how much of the run can be salvaged. Unlike many other games of this genre, has 500+ items to unlock and find, lots of characters to unlock, and plenty of secrets to hunt for and it all ties together cleverly for its story.

is about Isaac, a kid who ultimately blames himself for the divorce of his parents despite how his father was the one to walk out on him and his mother due to alcoholism and money problems, and so he copes with the situation by entertaining himself with the imagination his father encouraged him to have with cardboard that he has access to while his mother forbids it and even abuses him while turning to religion to also cope in her own way with the divorce, creating this narrative in his own little imaginary world that his mom hates him and holds him responsible for the divorce. As you continue to play and slay the bosses, it becomes an extremely dark, sad story that comes about in short pieces of narration from the voice of his father and the context clues you can gather. It's one of those games that perfectly employs the ""show, don't tell"" technique to tell a story that is so rich with how interpretive it is. The story itself (and what happens to Isaac) can be interpreted in different ways but it's very much about a child being mistreated and abandoned and escaping into a fantasy world, and I don't blame anybody for just searching the story explanation online due to the narrative complexity. It's rife with religious imagery and text and dark themes but this is really what makes the video game as great as what it is. It's a type of boldness that doesn't really exist in a lot of AAA video games because a lot of these companies are too scared to be creative and want to do everything they can to avoid offending the perpetually offended crowd, but this game is proof that some video games can still be art and that the form isn't entirely lost.

For anybody who owns the device, it's also a perfect game for the Steam Deck. I spent many hours in bed late at night just playing this game on my mobile device because I couldn't get enough of it at the time. It's a challenging game that makes you want to overcome the challenge for your own personal achievement and it's a game which I'd consider very addictive for a time. I would honestly classify as a game which every gamer should play.

The gameplay itself is simple and easy to understand but the combination of mystery, intrigue, challenge and the fun in its simplicity just keeps you coming back for more until you've mastered it, and its developer, Edmund McMillen, does well to even continue the story in other ways with his other video games even though it's not a direct sequel which I think is pretty cool as his other video games are also really good.",Recommended,3461,"1,124.8 hrs on record","Posted: November 26, 2024"

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561199211586068/,"The Binding of Isaac is a brilliantly unique game that combines dark themes with addictive gameplay. Its rogue-like elements make every playthrough feel fresh and unpredictable, with randomly generated dungeons, power-ups, and enemies. The variety of items and upgrades allows for endless strategies, and each new discovery adds a layer of excitement to the experience.

The art style is charmingly grotesque, perfectly matching the game's unsettling yet fascinating atmosphere. The narrative, inspired by biblical stories and psychological horror, is surprisingly deep, inviting players to explore Isaac's world and uncover hidden meanings and story fragments with each run.

The game’s difficulty is challenging but fair, and mastering its mechanics over time is incredibly rewarding. The Binding of Isaac strikes a perfect balance between skill, luck, and exploration, making it a game that feels equally satisfying whether you're diving in for the first time or returning after years.

MegaFudge,https://steamcommunity.com/id/MegaFudge/,"Took me almost 1000 hours to unlock everything and 100% the game. I would highly recommend using mods to improve some aspects of the game like being able to read item descriptions in game and telling apart tinted rocks and lucky coins from normal ones.
I would say a lot of the game is just getting lucky, but skill does offset how lucky you really need to be. There are a lot of cryptic unlocks that I used guides for since they are super specific like unlocking the forgotten or the ace of spades card. The Issac wiki is great for this.
Despite the game being unfair and cryptic half the time, the seemingly endless item combinations and ways to play and break the game are the biggest draw for me.

The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is incredible, and while I would say it got even better with every DLC, I unfortunately cannot say that is the case. Afterbirth and Afterbirth+ are kind of... mediocre, to say the least...

But Repentance? The game becomes one of the best games in the roguelike dungeon crawler genre I've ever seen. Incredible room, enemy, and item variety, plenty of unlockable content and an incentive to use every character, and the best part of every version, no matter the dlc, is the possible item combinations you can find and (commonly) win with.

I start negative because of the fact that the $20 base game and the $60 dollar full DLC experience are vastly different when compared to each other, but if you do buy everything up to Repentance, it is SO WORTH the money.",Recommended,743,248.6 hrs on record,Posted: February 13
Danielsfs,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Danielsfs/,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a game that has kept me captivated for over 700 hours, and it’s no surprise why. As someone who loves roguelikes, this game has a perfect balance of randomness, challenge, and progression that keeps you coming back for more. The replayability is absolutely off the charts, which is the heart of why I’ve invested so much time into it.

Every single run feels fresh, thanks to the massive variety of items, enemies, and synergies that change from one playthrough to the next. The randomized nature of each session means you’re constantly adapting and strategizing, finding new combinations and ways to approach the challenges the game throws at you. Whether you’re discovering a powerful item synergy or struggling to make it through a particularly difficult section, there’s always something new to experience in Rebirth.

The unlockables are another huge factor in its replayability. There’s always something to work toward, whether it’s unlocking new characters, items, or alternate endings. The game incentivizes you to keep playing, and each run offers a sense of progression as you get closer to unlocking new features or achieving personal milestones.

The controls and visuals in Rebirth have also been revamped from the original game, making it much smoother to play and more visually appealing. The soundtrack, which is both eerie and atmospheric, fits the tone perfectly, and the overall design gives it a unique charm.

What really makes Rebirth shine is how it effortlessly combines difficulty and fun. It’s a challenging game that punishes mistakes but never feels unfair. The constant drive to improve, explore, and see how far you can go is what kept me hooked for so many hours.

In summary, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a roguelike masterpiece with endless replay value. If you enjoy a game that’s always evolving and challenging, it’s impossible to recommend it enough. The sheer amount of depth, challenge, and reward makes every run feel worth it, and it’s a game that will have you coming back for hundreds of hours, just like it did for me.",Recommended,1759,781.8 hrs on record,Posted: January 20
brodahs,https://steamcommunity.com/id/brodahs/,"The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth – 10/10

Introduction

""The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"" is a game that combines everything great about classic roguelikes while bringing something fresh and deep to the table. It’s one of those titles that draws you in for long hours, offering an immense variety and exceptional playability.

Visuals

The first thing that stands out is the dark yet hypnotic visual style. The pixel art is simple but perfectly matches the game’s atmosphere. Each level is packed with details that can evoke both fascination and unease. As time progresses, the visuals become more surreal, making the journey through this nightmare world even more intense.


The gameplay in ""Rebirth"" is a rollercoaster ride. The game offers an endless combination of procedurally generated levels, enemies, items, and challenges, making each experience unique. You play as Isaac, a boy who must navigate through the hell of his own mind, battling demons from his past and facing monsters in various dungeons. Every run feels like a journey through the unknown, full of surprises and emotions. If you’ve played classic roguelikes before, this game feels like home – no two runs are the same.


A fascinating aspect is the item system, where you can find different items during your run. Each item changes the way you play – some surprise you, some make the game easier, but others can lead to unexpected difficulties. This variety allows for many different combinations, making each playthrough feel new and fresh. It’s the magic of randomness, which never gets boring.


An essential part of the game is its difficulty. ""Rebirth"" can be brutal, but it’s this high level of challenge that keeps players coming back. It’s a title for those who aren’t afraid of failure and who have the motivation to try again, improving their skills with each attempt. Successes are incredibly satisfying, and failures teach you, shaping your approach for the next round.


The soundtrack is another highlight. It fits perfectly with the dark atmosphere of the game, building tension without overwhelming the player. The music sets the tone for intense gameplay, making every encounter feel more immersive and exciting.


In conclusion, ""The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth"" is a game that pulls you in and doesn’t let go. With tons of secrets, challenges, and surprises, it’s one of the best roguelikes out there. Tough, rewarding, and offering endless hours of gameplay. 10/10.",Recommended,2065,27.8 hrs on record,Posted: February 21

The Binding of Isaac has always been a game near and dear to my heart ever since I dedicated the time to playing the Flash version of Isaac. The first game was my very first introduction to what roguelikes are undoubtedly left such an impression on me. When I saw this game coming out words couldn't express just how hyped to play it and now that I'm so far in this game after winning countless runs and laughing at just how messed up Isaac ends up getting both in appearance and item synergy, it's no wonder looking back now that this game had such a grip on me when I first got my hands on it.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198866216104/,"The definition of the genre of Roguelikes. This game is what every Roguelike enjoyer should have in their list.
Unlike Hades and Hades II, this game does not involve much story at all, but is gameplay-wise (in my opinion) at least 5 times more expansive than both the Hades series combined.
With each and every run being truly different and unique, this game delivers the most entertaining runs and playstyles within its category, and does not need to rely on fancy graphics nor an intriguing storyline to hook in players.

That being said however, this game is not really as straightforward as it seems or sounds. Many specific mechanics and special interactions have to be learned by the player as they slowly progress through the game's unlocks (It took me more than 100 hours to learn how to min-max every resource I am given). Do not worry, your patience is duly rewarded with what I describe as an enjoyably addictive experience.",Recommended,778,451.8 hrs on record,Posted: February 3
decaffeinateddoctor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/decaffeinateddoctor/,"One of my favorite games forever, Isaac is so lovable and the monsters, items, and environments are perfectly spooky and flavorful. I think this is one of the best roguelite games if you can tolerate the themes of abuse, since it is very polished and committed to its gameplay loop. There is so much variety and humor in how the hundreds of items affect each run, with loads of attention to detail for item synergy effects

I got Real Platinum God (all achievements) in base Rebirth before the Lost had Holy Mantle, yet with all the DLC now there is triple the content and I once again feel like I am new to the game. The new characters all push their strengths to the limit - at a cost. These unique playstyles are perfect for late-game experienced play with their additional complexity and challenge.

ennaraptor,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ennaraptor/,"Hi, everyone. Bindany Isaactano here, the internet's busiest game nerd! And it's time for a review of this Nicalis' game: The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. Disclaimer: I for sure have, at least, 1000+ hours on this game and played it since launch, but I was broke at the time, so here we are.

Hades? Cult of the Lamb? Dead Cells? Forget all of those. This is the true role model for what an amazing rogue-like is.

The game's core mechanics are simple: you walk, shoot, use items and bombs. That's all. But those mechanics end up growing with the number of runs you do and the hours you play. And winning a run is the easy part. Actually, you will probably have your first finished run on your second or third try, or even on your first try if you are lucky.

And here's the thing: the game only truly starts after you've finished around 10 to 15 runs. You will have a ton of content before that, but, as soon as you discover The Polaroid and The Negative, things turn upside down and you discover that you're far from experiencing everything the game has to offer.

Almost every item is simple and straightforward. So you will end up remembering what a lot of stuff does after just a couple of runs, and, when you notice, you will be a master at synergies and run optimization—just to discover that you don't know anything and there's a lot more to unlock.

The game has several milestones. Whenever you do X or Y objective in a run, you will unlock more floors, paths, items, characters, etc. And I for sure recommend getting all the DLCs. They increase the game's size by 3 to 4 times, no joke. Most roguelikes have the same path across all runs, with just the items and procedural generation to help with variety. But, with Isaac, every run can feel like a totally different game. Every finished run opens new doors to even more content. I know I'm repeating myself, but it's hard to put into words how amazingly this game uses rogue-like aspects in its favor.

And, with all that, there's the presentation. The art style is amazing. The pixel art has a lot of details and every item changes your character's appearance in some way. And the floors, especially the ones you unlock, are incredible—particularly the ones like Downpour, Burning Basement, Ashpit, Mausoleum, Cathedral...

And the music... Oh, God, the music... It's one of a kind. The composition, production, everything! Banger after banger. And, again, the music for the floors you unlock is just incredible, with the best one being, of course, the one that plays when you get Dad's Note.

germancats4,https://steamcommunity.com/id/germancats4/,"The Binding of Isaac is a really deep game when it comes to item synergies and what feels like millions of possible builds. Each item you pick up has the potential to change the way you play, like one might replace your regular tears with lazers or one makes you throw up big green explosive bombs, that do very high damage, but can also damage you, giving you a high risk, high reward play style. With around 700 different types of items to pick up and use, it offers a lot of variety to play with.

And the game offers many different types of characters to play as, all with a unique and distinct play styles. One might be all about getting hit on purpose to build up damage for the remaining floor you are in while one is the complete opposite, and only gives you one hit before you go down, with the upside of flight and tears that can travel through rocks and obstacles, as well as an unique dice item, giving you a potential re roll of the item you might not wanna take, with the downside of it sometimes deleting the item. Its like gambling in a way, you will do that a lot in the game. Take risks that pay off, but also might backfire on you

What i also like is the way achivements are tied to actual useful things. Each achivement you gain actually unlocks something new for you to find, like a new character, new floors, new paths to take and most importantly, new item unlocks. The achivement system is a good way to keep track off, what you might need to unlock next.

The one small negative i have to give is the game its the type of game you need a friend or a youtube guide to understand what to even do to unlock certain bosses or items. Its very cryptic and confusing if you dont understand it, but once you know, its easy to hop into the game and plan ahead where you want to go in your run, which boss you are working towards and so on.

Overall a highly recommended game, if you still are unsure if you like it, buy the regular game game Rebirth without the dlc, try it out and if you like it, buy all the dlc. (small warning, you might have problems with converting the save from the rebirth to newest repentance + DLC, so if you want to avoid it, you could also just buy everything all at once. Its worth it and you get 200+ hours out of it)",Recommended,1830,258.7 hrs on record,Posted: April 11
Imbisible,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Imbisible/,"The Binding of Isaac was one of THE Indie games back when they were only just starting to pop off. All good for the history of gaming, sure, but with Rebirth and all of the love it's gotten, it still remains the very peak of the whole ""action roguelike"" genre imo.
I'm sure you know the roguelike gameplay loop by now: you start a run with a bunch of randomized elements, try to get as far as you can, die, and depending on whatever milestones or goals you've achieved, you get some sort of meta progression that makes future runs easier. This one's top-down, room-based, and you can only shoot in four directions.

What makes Isaac so distinct isn't that it was a pioneer in the kill-me-come-back-stronger gameloop, but how you come back stronger after they kill you.
Rather than the Vampire Survivors/Hades/like 60% of roguelikes' point-shop meta progression system, with just riveting upgrade options like ""move +5% faster for 5 seconds after taking damage,"" and ""armor is increased by +5%,"" all of your power in Isaac comes from the items that you have.
There're hundreds of items and most of them are initially locked.
How do you unlock the items, you ask? Could it be a shop in the main menu where you spend research points (gained from killing things, how interesting is that)?
No.

The items, the characters, the level variety, and a lot of the bosses, are all tied to in-game challenges and milestones! Hundreds and hundreds of challenges! Hundreds and hundreds of milestones! The harder the challenges, the wackier the items! Shoot lasers! Shoot projectiles that on impact duplicate into more projectiles that on impact duplicate into more projectiles! Surround yourself with a ring of orbiting knives! Accidentally blow yourself up with explosive puke! Turn the whole screen WHITE!

The Binding of Isaac is absolutely the best roguelike I've ever played, and I LOVED Risk of Rain.
If you like roguelikes, and you haven't played Isaac—if you didn't at least try it long enough to think ""well, I think I get it, but I won't play anymore""—I'm sorry, but I'm not sure I know what you're doing, man.

anbanbanbanb,https://steamcommunity.com/id/anbanbanbanb/,"Well back when I played Isaac I didn't care about reviewing games as much as I do now, so here are some words for it.

It's a very solid game, solid enough to have basically have been one of the games that started the ""rogue-lite"" wave that is still going strong today. I think there is some merit in being a game where everyone looked up everything online and still kept playing it, just because the core loop of seeing your little baby guy getting more powerful and unlocking new things to make runs longer is very fun. Dying and restarting is fast and seeing how your runs go from 10 minutes to 50 feels rewarding, but it can become tiring if you're trying to unlock everything (something I gave up a long time ago).

The aesthetics in general are pretty fun, the gory and bloody but very round and cartoony characters have a lot going on for them and the weird distorted christianity can have its moments. It's definitively a hit-or-miss kind of thing and I've met a lot of people who thought it was too edgy or just annoying for them. Also, I feel like no one ever talks about the soundtrack, which is absolutely fantastic. I don't think there is a single track I dislike in this game, even the more abstract-sounding ones.

Lastly, I recently watched someone play the game for the first time and maybe it could be a bit less cryptic with its stuff? Things like making item descriptions available in the 'Stats' menu or listing the known items of a certain transformation, stuff like that. These aspects make me feel like maybe I shouldn't recommend Rebirth to someone today, but if you know what you're getting into - i.e. dying a lot for hours for no reason until you have a basic grasp of what's going on, and then doing it again - I think it still holds up in general.",Recommended,1453,165.4 hrs on record,Posted: January 5

To put it simply, this game is amazing.

To elaborate, I bought this game in November of 2023, and since then, I have sunk almost 400 hours into it.
Quickly it has become one of my most played games on steam, and this steam account has existed for a long time.

I am constantly learning new things about this game, the community is wonderful, there are so many amazing mods out there, it truly was and still is the of roguelikes, many other amazing games wouldn't exist without it.
There is just so much to love about this game.

The story, while simple, has made me cry multiple times (I wish I could give Isaac a hug, poor little guy needs one), the music is consistently great throughout the game, I constantly find myself humming the downpour theme.

A two digit losing streak wasn’t enough, no, you needed MORE. Because at any given moment you could have gotten a GOOD RUN.

This isn’t a case of delayed gratification. All you are waiting is for the Stockholm syndrome to kick in, make you believe you actually had a fun time so you can come and play at a later date.

I am NOT an avid gamer, but I am a vivid hater. I SUCK at the one thing I do in life – roguelikes and their fake feeling of progression are the only brainrot I tolerate. I’m not saying this from a moral high ground “my ♥♥♥♥ is better than yours because it’s less popular,” I’m saying it as a cry for help.

Once, there used to be a little boy who liked dinosaurs – being able to name most of them was quite impressive in all honesty. There was still some hope in the eyes of such naive youngblood, for he believed in a world in which progress and dedication could take you somewhere.

Now, his husk is dwelled by a much more disgusting and primitive being. No resemblance of that former self. The mere thought of linking these two together leads to no good. This new, yet weaker, hollow shell cannot grow, it has reached its peak, yet refuses to molt.

This self-created monster doesn’t play with mods, for they are not the intended experience. It does not check the wiki any longer, for what use their brain has if it is not to memorize every single item. Min-maxing is the fool’s daily bread, and let me tell you this one is not going to starve any time soon…

I don’t really want to be rescued. It’s better for this world of cardboard we live in if a pile of cinders such as myself is kept in captivity. Daydreaming got me this far in life already, we can just hope it keeps doing the trick after the little self-respect that remains is gone for good.

This is not a love letter, as there was no such thing during this whole experience. Thirty four characters. Twelve main objectives to do as every single one of them. Forty five challenges of dubious quality. At some point you have to collect every single one of the seven hundred and nineteen items. You tell me where there’s room for joy in all that.

The Binding of Isaac seems to be a pretty classic game - i wouldn't know though, having not played it. However, there is something I can comment on here, and that is the Binding of Isaac: Rebirth. After a quick look at some gameplay of the older version, this game, no pun intended, is a godsend.

Not only is the base game great, but for around $50 Australian, you essentially get an entire revamp of the games mechanics, tons of brand new items, features, bosses and endings. The replayability of this game simply cannot be overstated. As someone whom, at the time of writing is probably about a 3rd of the way through, I must say I am so impressed with this game. The sheer amount of just... Stuff is so insane. The game takes 100s of hours to complete, and from what i know is made by a small developer.

Initially, I must admit I did not like this game. As someone who plays a lot of competitive games, all the luck based features annoyed me, but I have now grown to love them. That feeling of getting a gold in counter strike is replaced by getting Brimstone or any of the Seraphim items. This game is truly a work of art. Great story, and great gameplay.

I played just the base game for ~75 hours, dropped it and then recently purchased the Afterbirth DLC to play with a new save. Feels like a new game again. There's two more DLCs I can repeat this with :P

This is a good candidate for a ""forever"" game basically that you don't need to be a try-hard to enjoy. I recommend getting the mod to see item descriptions after you've played enough of it blind. It gets too tedious remembering/looking up descriptions of each item when there's so many of them.

nastiestkactus,https://steamcommunity.com/id/nastiestkactus/,"If there's an uncontested face on the roguelike Mt. Rushmore, it's The Binding of Isaac (Repentance). It is genre defining in many aspects and still a good game even if you have nothing to compare it to. I've often seen the game described as an ungraceful and messy game that's fun anyways, but I think that's only true as far as Edmund's delightful habit of trolling his player base goes. In most regards, what makes Isaac timeless is the fact that many of its mechanics are simple but provide endless room for the most defining trait of any good video game: ZANINESS.

Almost every character in Isaac has a simplistic, projectile-based basic attack that can undergo any ridiculous set of modifiers from the game's ludicrous item count. It can do anything from carpet bombing bosses to shooting jelly donuts that fly outside the bounds of the map and then wrap around to shooting reflective bullets that hurt you. It is simple, it's funny, it's timeless. The less appreciated aspect of Isaac is the resource game, to me. Isaac is uniquely interesting as a roguelike because it offers a way to utilize every type of resource the game offers you in a plethora of ways. Cards, health, bombs, keys, coins, all of them have a plethora of use cases and Isaac offers perhaps the most proactive options for Risk vs Reward to try and control the outcome of your runs I've seen in any game. Maybe not the most effective - Isaac still feels uniquely privy to just terrible runs in a way that many other Roguelikes you can rock a >90% winrate on don't have, but to me that's not a bug, it's just a feature. Getting Bob's Brain as The Lost is a hazing ritual all of us have to go through.

There's plenty else to appreciate. Isaac's aesthetic is often off-putting to newcomers, but kind of charming in its cartoony and grotesque way, and many items and bosses from this game have become famous for a legitimate funny or cool factor that you can't dispute. The game is ripe with unlockables - frankly, too many of the ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ things, but you can unlock everything relevant to accessing all the major parts of the game fairly easy and after that it's an enjoyable game to slowly chip away and and accumulate a wealth of funny items and modifiers to the game.

The only real critiques of Isaac I feel as though I could possibly make all stem at earlier expansions which made a lot of flawed or weird choices, but most of the serious ones are addressed or optional by the current state of the game with Repentance. Honestly, as far as actual options for this game go, either Vanilla or Repentance are very enjoyable, so whatever you get you're in for a time that's worth recommending the game to me.",Recommended,2205,371.2 hrs on record,Posted: March 22

howdoIsetacustomurl,https://steamcommunity.com/id/howdoIsetacustomurl/,"If you've ever wanted to ruin all other roguelikes in the history of ever for you with a game so phenomenally made it actually kind of borders on insane, get Isaac (and get the DLC Repentance, too. This game is not the same without the DLCs). Barring the last of the admittedly dumb online daily timegated achievement, as of this post I have 100%'d the game, what's known as ""Dead God""ing, and with my previous hours and hours of flash Isaac to aid my skill level going into the game, it STILL took nearly 600 full hours, yet not a SINGLE TIME did it feel monotonous, boring, predictable, and unfair. The amount of content is this game is staggering, and while there are definitely some oddly specific and kind of cheap achievements and moments, it is chock full of rewarding moments.

Every run you win contributes to something - feels like you're making headway in some way or another, and that's because YOU ARE. Doing anything and everything on any and all characters provides unlocks or various types, whether that be game progression, items, new game mechanics, etc. These mechanics in question are simultaneously hands-off while also incredibly nuanced, (for the most part) entirely learnable, and expansive beyond my wildest dreams. Hell, the amount of unique synergies in this game alone is enough for 600 hours to not scratch the surface - we're talking ""infinite pokemon"" levels here. The name of the game here is min-maxing, too, a skill picked up through trial and error that eventually results in an ability to truly persevere through any run, no matter how bad it may feel, or how ""unlucky"" you may be. Still, however, at no point does Isaac prove itself impossible to complete any run, even with astronomically unlucky statistical odds, and I think that alone is a shining beacon of achievement many of its contemporaries have consistently failed to do. In other words, you can truly take any hodgepodge of random mess possible and still have a successful run, so long as you apply the items you have in a novel and unique way. For those already acquainted with Isaac's mechanics, my point is that Quality 4 items does not a good run make. Sometimes all you need to win a run as The Lost is a mind perceptive enough to pick up ""Blank Card"" early in the shop and scrounge around in every way you can for cards until you can find ""The Lovers?"".

In essence, Isaac is a game where you truly build what you want to, with the game's random elements almost serving as a sandbox of sorts for your own imagination and risk-reward decision making skills, instead of falling into the all-too-common roguelike trap of being bottlenecked by game systems that don't reward you for hard work equal to any other run. Isaac is a game for people who love to experiment, and those who always have an open mind to what cards they're dealt. Don't R your way into a good run. Those Best Bud runs you keep skipping have the very same boundless opportunity as the rest. You just have to see it through and apply yourself. This is one of the greatest games ever made, bar none. 600 hours well spent.",Recommended,2546,598.3 hrs on record,Posted: January 28

The story is quite moving in a way you rarely see with even AAA games, and I love it for that, I was brought to tears after seeing many of the endings, and a few times after dying very far into a run with good items. If you're any good at top-down shooters/rogue-likes, I'd recommend you buy it and the DLCs. Hell, I recommend it even if you aren't good at them, it's a good way to get better.

Gameplay is addicting and repetitive allowing for mastery, the artstyle and themes are dark yet appealing, and offers greater and greater challenges that lie waiting for you when you're equipped with the skill to tackle them. I much prefer watching people who are better than me play this game but everyone's gotta start somewhere, and this game might be exactly what you're looking for. There are major themes of religious trauma and abuse as well so heads up there. The DLC is a must have if you want to take the full dive yourself, but if you want to try it, start with the base Rebirth and grab the rest later if you enjoy the gameplay.

Игра — это как поход в школу 1 сентября: тебя кидают в рандомные комнаты, где на каждом шагу пытаются вынести. Монстры? Это же сборная солянка всех моих школьных врагов: гигантские мухи, какашки и какие-то демоны, которые выглядят, как троечники с задней парты. А ты, вместо чтобы драться, тупо рыдаешь! Пацаны, тут ВЕЩИМО можно мочить врагов своими слезами! Это как на контрольной по алгебре, когда понял, что списывать забыл.

Лут и предметы

Про предметы вообще молчу... *Чё это за соска?* *Почему у меня три глаза?* *И какого хрена я хожу с дохлым котом?* Тут предметов столько, что твой школьный пенал позавидует, причём всё это собирается рандомно, как расписание уроков в конце августа. Комбо бывают такие дикие, что ты чувствуешь себя чемпионом, а потом... бац, и ты опять в ж*пе!


Атмосфера! Как будто застрял в школьной столовке на большой перемене: мрачно, стремно, но привыкаешь. А Ладно вам, пиксели топовые, стиль как у игры для настоящих олдов. Важно же не как выглядит, а как горит твоя ж*па, а она тут горит

Graphics

While the graphics might appear simple at first glance, they perfectly complement the game's morbid and unsettling tone. The pixelated art style, reminiscent of classic 16-bit games, adds a layer of nostalgia and charm. The character designs are grotesque and disturbing, yet somehow endearing, with Isaac's various forms and the bizarre enemies adding to the game's distinct atmosphere.


The soundtrack is a masterpiece, perfectly capturing the game's unsettling atmosphere. It blends melancholic melodies with distorted soundscapes, creating a chilling and memorable soundscape. The music intensifies during challenging encounters, adding to the tension and pushing players to the edge of their seats.


Rebirth is a challenging and unforgiving game that requires strategic thinking and quick reflexes. Each run is unique, offering a wide variety of items, enemies, and challenges. The constant need to adapt and make quick decisions keeps players on their toes and creates a thrilling sense of danger. The gameplay loop is addictive and rewarding, encouraging players to keep pushing for just one more run, even after repeated failures.


The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth is a game that stays with you long after you've finished playing. It's a testament to the power of challenging gameplay, unique art style, and a powerful soundtrack. The game's dark humor and unsettling atmosphere create a truly memorable experience that will appeal to fans of roguelikes and anyone looking for a unique and challenging game.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198055169132/,"Honestly? To me, this is one of the most influential games in regards to modern roguelite gaming. While it made some, perhaps unpopular, decisions, such as having many an item work against the player, it was a satisfying game, though it's the sequel to, iirc, a, (incredibly popular) flash game? This roguelite seems heavily inspired by The Legend of Zelda(NES), even directly referencing it with the Ladder unlockable item. Within this game the player, as Isaac or a host of enjoyable alternate characters, navigates a labyrinth of randomly generated rooms, each floor holding secrets to discover, and plenty of, impure, enemies. You may notice some, not so understated, religious themes within the game, being a recurring theme within the storyline, after all, even the name is a biblical reference. It's s all the better for it, promise. This is not a promise nedessarily, but, this game, may help you work through some religious trauma, as it did me.

Hard recommend.

Difficult, there's no doubt about that, but rewarding. It has not only an interesting storyline, but hundreds of items and thousands of unique item combinations, as well was fun to use synergies.

It's well worth the price. Especially if you're one whom values replayability and/or playtime, as I'm pretty sure I have over 1000 hours played ;;

Not for the... ♥♥♥♥, what's the word, prude?s uptight? Christ. I think you get it though.

this game will always hold a dear place in my heart.

An Experience.Perhaps relevant side note: I *did* have 'hovieism(jehovah's witnessism) forced upon me from birth, never allowed to take part in holidays, nor birthdays, in school, until I rid myself of the label at age ten. Talk about religious trauma lmao

I love you Ed Mcmillan and um, the... Nicalis team!

Check out Cave Story+ if you haven't alredy. Also a great experience! Though running hell may wear on your sanity, should you choose pain x9 It's really cute and even tugs on the heartstrings, also a very influential game. I miss those Mimiga babies. The soundtrack is amazing, especially if you enjoy a chiptune or two, though of coure there are more modern asounetrack options

You will have to decide if this is your thing or not. I assure you, in case you are not used to this genre, in the very beginning when you're still learning how to do everything, you will 100% get very frustrated at times.
I suppose that was the intention of the developers.

I am one of those players that didn't have experience at all in Roguelikes. I knew what they are and how they function, but I didn't play any of them properly at all.

What I can tell is that although I got irritated often early on, I got used to the game mechanics, and once I got used to them, I was completely unbothered by them.
Don't get me wrong, I still have my opinion that Isaac could have been a lot better, but not everyone will see it the way I view it.
Others will say that all of those inconveniences make Isaac what it is today and why it's this popular and beloved.
So at the end of everything, my opinion is my opinion, you will have to decide for yourself.


There’s a vast amount of content here—truly, a lot. The more you complete the game, the larger the pool of items, monsters, bosses, and floor levels gets.

Players are given an incentive to keep playing, provided they want to challenge themselves a bit, as the game consistently rewards the time and effort invested.

I can’t speak to how difficult it is to achieve 100% completion, as that wasn’t my goal, I prefer to explore other games as well, not only focus entirely only on one. However, it’s clear there’s a substantial amount to unlock and accomplish for those who are completionists.

I haven’t looked into it in depth, but I hope the achievements aren’t tied to extremely rare or arbitrary events that make them frustrating to earn.

In short, if you’re looking for a game with near-endless replayability, The Binding of Isaac is certainly one of those titles.


Once more, it's in your judgment whether it is good or not.

Personally, I don't mind it; it's not even a discussion of liking it or disliking it. I think it gets the job done; it's what it's supposed to do, and it's not bad.

I've played the entire thing on hard, and I didn't think it was all that hard at the end of everything.
It was fine.

What I will say, though, is don’t get discouraged if you can’t beat the levels for one reason or another. A decent number of people can be pretentious snobs, and they love calling others bad just because they don’t have the same level of experience. What they don’t realize is they’re just gatekeepers, preventing new players from enjoying the same things they love about the game.
I’d suggest these folks try out new genres of games they’re not used to, instead of just sticking to the ones that are easier to pick up, or already in their comfort zone—let’s see how they handle that.


I repeat, by the end of it, I was unbothered by the design of the game because I got used to it, but that doesn't mean it didn't affect my enjoyment in the early parts.

The RNG was too much for me. It was either a fun run or complete torment, depending on how boring the items I received were. That made everything feel lame and slow. I didn’t like how you could finish an entire floor without getting any reward from it, especially since the items you did receive were either useless or actually made things worse.

Questions started popping into my mind: why am I doing this if there's no proper reward? Just a chance at one, and strictly that.

I believe it could have been balanced better. Not everything needs to be left up to chance. I do agree that some RNG adds a lot of replay value, but at the same time, it can turn the experience into a bit of a circus. And without mods, you don’t even know what the items are doing. You have to suffer through it to learn. That’s what the devs wanted, I guess. It’s their game. I can’t change what they view as good if they have a certain vision.

For me, I preferred having challenges on floors, something where you have to fight to evolve your stats like speed, damage, health, and so on. Not getting 100 items that all basically do the same thing. It’s not too interesting to get a 0.3 movement speed buff item as your reward.

Yes, I know, those fun items can make it too easy to win. So balance them in such a way where they’re not broken. I’ll take fun and interesting over everything else in this environment.

Co-op is already hard to balance, since you can beat the game effortlessly with multiple people.

They make sure RNG is always present, no matter how much depth you have in your Isaac game knowledge or how well you know what every item does. You’ll still have floors where the items are shown with a question mark, meaning you don’t know what you’re picking up.

Once again, it’s like they’re trying to make it a potential pain in the butt if you decide to take a chance on those question mark items.
You either pick them up and risk it, or skip them, which, again, basically means no reward for you. No chance at fun, if you catch my drift.




Are Isaac's traumas supposed to be jokes, or are they meant to be taken seriously though?

In one of his memories, he looks at the clouds, and the cloud gives him the middle finger, which makes him start crying.

In another, you see Isaac having a nightmare of him having a nightmare of him having a nightmare.

They’re jokes, aren’t they?

Would recommend for just base game alone as you can do local multiplayer and have fun that way (though it is different without dlc), but dlc is constantly being fixed and updated along with repentance plus. Nothing is ever really the same between runs and as you play more, you get more characters you can unlock to change up the gameplay that much more and even cool challenges you can try by yourself or with friends.

7.65612E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198046513274/,"What horrors wait in the dark? Dwell into the unknown depts and learn secrets better kept hidden. Binding of Isaac: Rebirth was developed by Nicalis and released in 2014. This game is a top down, roguelike, dungeon crawler twin stick shooter, that can be controlled either by keyboard or controller.

As you boot up the game, the story is presented every time, but as a summary to escape his mother Isaac dives into the basement and the game starts. Armed initially only with his tears you must kill every enemy in the room for its doors to open so you can progress. Different rooms can appear on each floor, from treasure rooms that contain items that modify your character in many possible ways, to stores hold items to be bought, to the boss room and many others, some not even being initially visible, but knowing patterns they can be accessed.

Speaking of items, this game has a vast array of items that interact with other items, making your survival easier or harder, all dependent on the items chosen. A good portion of fun this game offers is learning not only learning builds that work better for your playstyle, but learning all the possible interactions items have, and how to optimize them.

The enemies’ design is also something to be discussed. Some enemies have a rather simple look, but as you dive deeper and deeper, enemies become more deformed and twisted, and like the items, learning enemy patterns is key to surviving.

As you gain experience in the game and win a few runs, you may discover more characters, items and even new floors, further increasing the complexity of this game and the replay value. There are also challenges that unlock specific items and daily challenge runs, which may provide something more for experienced players.

With all secrets, items to be discovered, the different characters and runs, it is easy to recommend The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth.

I been playing this game recently and for being new to the rougelike and indie game and controller supported game, i REALLY recommend this game for beginner, its a beginer friendly game in my opinion and is easy to learn.
+ with the new updates that allow coop for 2-4 players, it is really great to play with friends and family, you can also play online with random stranger and a fun way to begin the journey for more rougelike like tboi (The binding of Isaac).

ilovemirojaro,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ilovemirojaro/,"Steam should really add some kind of ""Mixed Feelings"" option for reviews. I'm giving this a negative review because I personally don't enjoy it, but I don't quite think it's a ""bad"" game and it's not something I would warn people away from or anything. And I do think there are plenty of good things to say about it.

I know it's weird to only realize this after 455 hours, but I'm starting to think that I don't like this game.

My main problem is how luck plays such a huge factor in your success. Worse, it the main determiner of whether or not the game is fun. Playing this game feels like playing a slot machine; the only time your having fun is when you're getting lucky. And you will be unlucky very often, to the point that it feels like the majority of the time.

If you happen to not get any DPS upgrades, which is a common occurrence, the game will be extremely frustrating and unsatisfying. If you get Curse of the Blind (which happens at random) and you decide to pick up an item, you can easily end up with some worse-than-useless item that ruins your run. Sometimes you'll just never get keys for the shops or item rooms. This is especially bad for new players, since most of the good items are locked behind achievements.

It's even a meme in the community to constantly reset the run over and over until you get a good item in the first item room. They even added an item in reference to this practice. The fact that so many people do this is kinda proof in itself how grating this game is if you don't get lucky early on.

This is compounded by the fact that the enemies and bosses are just downright obnoxious. I'm sure part of this is just that I suck, but many of the enemies and bosses range from unfun to fight to annoying to straight up ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. In fact, you can tell that a fair few bosses, enemies and room layouts were intentionally designed to unfair or annoying, or at least the devs have since realized it and deliberately decided not to fix them.

If you have a strong run it's not that bad, but if you have a mediocre or god-forbid a bad run, then the enemies that suddenly leap across entire rooms in random directions or teleport on top of you or fire lasers in unpredictable patterns will really start to grate on your patience.

So why did I play this game for so long when it's so frustrating? Because, much like a slot machine, it's undeniably addictive. Because when you finally DO get a good run, it feels awesome. Getting Tammy's Head + Brimstone in Isaac is like the vidyagaming equivalent of getting 4 aces in Poker.

A large part of the new DLC is a free community mod (Antibirth) being integrated in the game via DLC, worth noting that Antibirth is a windows only mod
While there is new content in the DLC, it seems questionable to endorse developers that are integrating community modifications through paid DLC

The game is addicting and certainly unique and even fun at times. However with each update and DLC, Edmund and a majority of tryhard fans, pushed the narrative of ""balance and pure BS difficulty=fun"" leading into the Repentance DLC.

The core of Isaac has always been addictive and well designed, however the longer Rebirth drags on with these slogs of updates the more and more it just becomes ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥. Obnoxious room layouts, rooms which require esoteric knowledge to avoid damage, an overwhelming amount of enemies that are just unsatisfying to fight, etc. Currently the biggest issue with Repentance is that everything just feels bad. Isaac is now the type of game now where you don't upgrade your character to feel ""good"", you upgrade your character so that the obnoxious elements of the game are sightly less obnoxious to deal with. It is just irritating, and going from Afterbirth+ (which was still riddled with these issues, just to a lesser degree) to Repentance really shoves it in your face how much more anti-fun this game's difficulty has become. Afterbirth+ True Co-Op is some peak, and it has remained the most fun mod I have used for this game, but any vanilla Isaac really feels like dragging your balls through glass after Repentance.",Not Recommended,928,361.0 hrs on record,Posted: February 15

The animations and everything about the game are just fine! fun to look at even. There were however some mechanics to the game that I just didn't enjoy. The turds were too tough. The 'upgrades' were not very substantial sometimes. And acquiring a build was entirely left to RNG. I 'beat the game' after a matter of 3 hours but that was only because I got a couple of ridiculously strong upgrades that just happened to synergize. The lack of a choice make the only way to play just blasting through as fast as you can to acquire some kind of wild build that actually works and dying about 50 times before each good run.

7.66E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198292757177/,"This game bothers me. Don't get me wrong; this is a very fun game. My memories of it are positive. Unfortunately, whenever I boot this game up for a run, I can't help but compare it to the significantly smoother experiences provided by games that use Isaac as a direct inspiration, and have since built upon the original concept to great success. This game is showing its age, and the three DLC expansions can't cover up the cracks of what is essentially a renovated Flash game.

The game play is the most chaotic I've ever experienced in a game of its genre. Items are hilariously unbalanced. About 80% of the items you can encounter are complete crap, and I have a theory as to why. This game is filled with trite references, and most of the items present in the game are there for the sake of being references. Therefore, most of the items in Isaac were not implemented to add variety in how you play the game, or even to increase your stats. Most of the items are functional afterthoughts, and the references get boring when they are both extremely outdated, and actively sabotaging success in a run by taking the place of items I actually want. Unlike other rogue-likes, base Isaac is way too weak. When I play this game, I don't hope for good items, I feel like I need them. This is because the later bosses have so much health, even if you learn their patterns, it'll take way too long to kill them. If the game decides to give me bad items, I always lose. If it decides to give me good items, I always win. So am I playing a game or a lottery? Getting a high win streak means nothing to me when I can only keep it high when the game lets me. Additionally, the game does not bother to tell you what the items do until you pick them up. This can potentially ruin your run, and is objectively stupid.

Speaking of stupid, the story is meaningless. I've seen the endings, and I have a general idea of what went down. Unfortunately, the writing shot itself in the foot immediately by making Isaac five years old. I don't know about you, but when I was five, I was a brainless drooling baby that played Pokemon by mashing the A button. It's impossible for this game to take place in his imagination, or for him to have any complex thoughts about what's happening. It's sad, but in the sense that watching gore videos is sad. It's just pointlessly violent and repulsive because that is the aesthetic of the game. It's gross and ugly, and nothing else. If I, as the player, can not contribute to the story, it has no place in the game. It adds nothing, and makes me sad.

I played so much of this game because I had experienced it before I played other rouge-likes. Among its peers, this is not the prettiest, the most fun, rewarding, balanced, or fair rouge-like. Not even close. But I'd be lying to you if I didn't say it left a large impact on me and wider gaming community. It might have aged like milk as I keep coming back to it over the years, but it inspired me to draw tons of fan-art, and I even ended up coding a mod for it.

also a lot of rooms are almost impossible if you dont have enough speed/damage or need tas level movement

and like 30% of the enemies have the exact same unfun mechanic (making you wait for 10 seconds for them to become killable/appear and then they become unkillable for another 10 seconds and in that process they can spawn on top of you and hit you) so thats good game design

also the hurtboxes are abysmal and this is made even worse with items like technology or when fighting enemies that stick to the walls

also lazarus is straight up ass and theres no reason to play him especially when comparing him to other more interesting characters the game has (interesting meaning they are just insanely op like azazel but atleast thats something instead of just being isaac but without d6 less health and with a slight dmg up)

also the stats menu is horrible and you dont get to see your stats in a useful understandable way until you buy ab+/repentance

the game is just not really fun but by the time i realized i already had like 60 hours so i guess that makes it good right

the only good aspects that i could find after 150 hours were that the minmaxxing you can do in this game is mindblowing and i absolutely love it but boss rush exists so you only get to do it with characters that you already have 100%ed so thats not really applicable and the sound design is incredibly satisfying (the ost is just good at best and mid at worst btw)

7.66E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198080196486/,"Introduction
As I sit here, reminiscing, I find myself rather surpised by the fact that I’ve never written a review for The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, which was first released in 2014 to rave reviews by indie darling Edmund McMillen and publisher Nicalis Inc., cheifly known for their Cave Story+ Remake of Daisuke ""Pixel"" Amaya's ""Cave Story"" from 2004, which provided much of the kindling for the explosion of the modern indie games scene, but I digress.
After all, TboI: Rebirth it’s my most played game on Steam, and yet it’s one of my most reviled. For you see, behind great music by Ridiculon (though far removed quality wise from the phenomenal works of Danny Baranowsky or even Mudeth’s work on the original OST for the game’s mod “Antibirth”), behind a fantastic, deeply personal and indirectly introspective narrative from the developer Edmund McMillen, lies a slot machine. Most of my time spent in The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth was in its first permutation, the titular “Rebirth”, an ambitious reimagining of 2011’s “The Binding of Isaac” and its DLC “The Wrath of The Lamb”. This version was the only version that was anywhere close to something worthy of the descriptors “good” or “well designed”, but even it, the farther you got to its completion, revealed more and more of its artistically rich facade to be a smoke and mirrors show for a much more facile Random Number Generator with a dark humor and theme-rich coat of paint.

A frequent joke made at this game’s expense by even its most rabid fans is that the game often turns into a “Hold R” simulator, where you hold R, to keep restarting runs until you spawn next to an item room with an item that isn’t one of the bloated item pool’s many useless positions. The two paid DLCs, Afterbirth and Afterbirth +, exacerbated all the issues with the game’s RNG, while fixing some issues from the older versions. Every version of the game sells itself on the promise of improvement of old faults, before inevitably adding new ones (often more glaring ones) of its own. It’s a never-ending cycle of Edmund expecting the community to pay another 10$ every few years for a new “final DLC” filled with fixes and content galore! Yet, save for the game’s newest DLC “Repentance” (which requires the prior two to run!) they only ever bloat item pools and help to show how little Edmund McMillen understands the game, which he’s made.
Isaac is not, by any means, a skillful game: all your characters move as if permanently on ice skates, baffling room layouts provide unavoidable damage to unlucky players without the proper items and stat increases, the player’s hitbox is an atrocious mess, with no option to toggle to at least see the malformed thing, and yet Edmund clearly thinks of it as a competent, skillful Bullet Hell experience, with bosses that counteract overpowered items and item synergies with spongy shields and bullet patterns that would be at home in Enter The Gungeon or a Touhou game, but with a barely readable 2.5D, slanted perspective.
The game was–and still is–wildly known for its “god runs”, where players attain great power through wacky and fun item synergies, and yet, the irreversible damage that the bloat of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth’s item pool has attained through its first two DLCs and the countless questionable rebalances and horrendously designed, overly long, RNG-reliant challenges/endings (such as the time-gated challenges, that only open if you get to a place quick enough), these runs, the only fun part of the game, has been made harder and harder to access, like a casino slowly making your win chances lower and lower, hoping to artificially eek out more money and time from their consumers. The game’s lead developer, Edmund McMillen, has proven over the last few years to not care about players as empowered intellects striving for artistic and ludological fulfillment, and instead as consumers. Edmund cares about money and how much time you sink into his product (yes, not “art”, but product) and how much of that time he can extract out through ever more elaborate constructions of artificial difficulty to make you chase great highs once remembered from the game’s better (and yet still often vapid) versions.
McMillen has never understood how to make good difficulty curves and fun completionist criteria, but when his ineptitude to do so is combined with a roguelite design, he drops the ball even harder, through conflating difficulty with RNG and trolling the player, while locking game content (run-changing items) behind these vacuously conceived trials.

Edmund McMillen is just a flat out bad game designer. He has good ideas and great art and themes, but he hasn't evolved. His games have stayed qualitatively roughly the same since Super Meat Boy. I'd also be remiss not to mention his scummy behavior with Isaac and it's board game. 500 different limited editions for Four Souls, along with four DLCs for Isaac, each of which fix glaring design flaws and bugs and then add in new ones, that you'll probably need to pay another 10$ (or however much) for a DLC to fix.
Also... Basement Collection, a lazy, AAA tier port of old Flash games with completely untouched optimization, making it barely playable on even modern hardware due to memory leaks aplenty!
Edmund is the closest to a greedy AAA exec that the indie games industry has, besides all the asset flip, AI and crypto slop mills. There are many small indie developers struggling to make it, who really deserve your money and time, McMillen is not one of them and Nicalis Inc. are certainly not worthy of these ever more valuable resources either.",Not Recommended,4687,956.9 hrs on record,"Posted: December 14, 2024"

The massive success this game has had, the development team size and the game's scope should have allowed addressing these issues when the community first made them loud and clear for the developers, considering also that the only bare-bones free content update has been Repentance+, the rest of the added content has been paid by the players.",Not Recommended,599,258.5 hrs on record,Posted: May 2

That is until you realize that a vast majority of the items in the game are absolutely terrible, and that there's no consistent way to get good ones, which is where the main part of the game's fun comes from.

Devil Room pool is full of trash, treasure room pool is full of trash, boss room pull is full of trash, shop pool is full of trash. Angel Room pool is good, but not consistent and sometimes not enough. Needing to not get hit to get decent items from the angel room pool means you'll need to hold the R key until you get an initial good item from a treasure room, which is super tedious and unfun. Even then, sometimes it's not enough, especially on hard mode, which should be called tedious mode.

In conclusion, people overrate this game to an astounding degree because it has a lot of cool stuff in it. It's more of a movie than a video game, but unfortunately it's just incredibly unfun after any considerable amount of time put into it.",Not Recommended,834,431.6 hrs on record,Posted: March 1

bongbongwater,https://steamcommunity.com/id/bongbongwater/,"The Binding of Isaac is a very great game, which isn't what you probably expected to read in the negative reviews. I've sunk almost 100 hours into this game at the time of writing this and I expect to play much more with the newly added online co-op and countless tainted character unlocks I'm yet to obtain.

However I do not feel like I should write a positive review for Isaac, people give this game lots of well deserved praise due to its deep item synergies and addictive gameplay loop, which are incredibly valid things to praise it for. Seriously, if Isaac sounds like a game you'd like, buy it, you'll like it. Unfortunately though it is plagued with many aspects and elements that lead to it failing where other games in the rougelike genre succeed.

I'll start with something simple: Hard Mode.
Isaac's implementation of a harder difficulty is not well designed, and unfortunately it is a requirement to play it to obtain all the unlocks. The approach to increased difficulty does not involve making the player think faster on their feet and play differently, and just makes things that should be convenient such as blood donation machines and slots much more annoying, while reducing opportunities to regain my health with lower heart spawn rates, flat out nerfing some active items and several more mildly annoying tweaks. While I do commend it for limiting the easier room placements from spawning, the bad outweighs the good, I don't feel like I'm rewarded for good situational awareness which is what harder difficulties are expected to promote, and it just feels like Inconvinient Mode instead of Hard Mode.

You could just say skill issue or whatever, but at least Hard Mode is optional so I've just chosen not to play it like many others probably have too. My main issues with the game come from Isaac's accessibility issues and poor attack telegraphing. Many enemies have attacks that are spewed out the moment the game decides it wants the enemy to do this, which leads to it being almost impossible to react at times. Brimstone is especially guilty of this, while having charge up animations on most enemies it's incredibly difficult to tell where the beam will go, which is why I had to resort to a mod that would add that for me and make brimstone based attacks actually fair in rooms that take up more space than just 1 screen.

Mom's foot is horribly designed, along with her boss as a whole. Looking out for a shadow in an incredibly dark environment such as Depths/Necropolis is tedious and annoying, and the sound cue of her grunting doesn't help much either since you either won't be able to tell it apart from her other noises or it'll get drowned out by the copious amount of enemy spawns in this tiny cramped arena, which is it's own entire can of worms in itself.
Spawning enemies during her boss doesn't feel fair, at least to me. You already are being barraged by upwards of 2 arms at a time from each door, Mom's foot and each corner of the arena is basically unusable due to the rocks, it's already an incredibly tight space to fight such a chaotic boss, yet enemies are still thrown in for very obvious difficulty padding reasons. Just more things to shoot so you can't focus on Mom.
There is a champion variant of Mom that doesn't spawn enemies, and it's way better, the foot is more frequent but at least you have the free attention span to focus on it, and the arms/eyes in the doors are a much more prominent threat to take up the space the enemies once filled, which feels a lot more fair on the player. I still get absolutely clapped by that fight but I've never felt as though it's the games fault which is a large issue in the original mom fight. This game isn't allergic to good bosses though, is a great fight that feels fair despite it being a bullet hell, the player gets many chances to attack and reposition, if you die you let that happen and it's your fault, which is a good thing but also a stark contrast to most of the other fights.

After you beat Mom for the first time you'll unlock the Womb/Utero floors, which let you fight Mom's Heart. This fight is okay compared to the last, still suffers from enemy spawn ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ but what are you gonna do, it's just bullet hell. The issue is that in order to get actual progression and unlock new areas/characters/items, you have to fight it ELEVEN TIMES, and that isn't even the worst of it, because respectively have to be beaten 5 times each (which I still haven't done the latter, because I actually enjoyed progressing between runs) I kinda get why it's there, it used to be the end from my knowledge so they needed some post game content but with Afterbirth and Repentance it's just a giant wall in the middle of what could be a smooth part of the game that feels fun and rewarding.

(Also every floor past Depths doubles enemy damage allowing them to deal full hearts instead of half hearts, there is no indication this happens and it's a terrible design decision but it did it's job at making me play more defensively I guess. This is the kinda stuff they could've put in hard mode and it would've fit way better.)

Speaking of, if you beat as Blue Baby you unlock the D6 as a starting item for Isaac, which lets you reroll any pedestal item you find. This instantly turns Isaac from the weakest to the most powerful amongst the entire roster, which was likely the intent, but it means he absolutely overshadows anyone else for grinding out the rest of the game. If you're struggling with getting a good run to beat a hard boss you can just play Isaac instead and be twice as likely to get a perfect run with all the good items. Tainted Isaac from Repentance does it well though and I do wish that principle was applied to normal Isaac instead, limiting inventory space but allowing more build control, Tainted Isaac is strong but not the best amongst the Tainted Cast (at least out of those I've unlocked so far).

I think that's the brunt of my issues with Isaac. I will reiterate though I like this game, Isaac is cool and I'm having fun with it, I just don't feel as though leaving a positive review is an accurate description of how I feel about it.

The positive reviews are not lying, this game is great, I just wish it could be better than it is.",Not Recommended,5142,215.5 hrs on record,Posted: February 13

7.66E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561198840169991/,"This is a game built upon time-wasting and frustration.

Look at other reviewers' playtimes.
10% of that time is spent moving across the field,
20% resetting until you get strong gear
30% slowly fighting enemies while missing attacks due to weak equipment.

This is a game about enjoying item synergies.
Every enemy in this game is hard to aim at—they constantly dart around.
Fighting them without decent items is absolutely unfun (I mean absolutely). It's nothing but frustration and wasted time.
The core design philosophy revolves around gradually improving frustrating combat through items—in other words, the reduction of discomfort. This much is acceptable game design.

However, this game repeatedly reduces your opportunities to obtain items.
This is where the design fatally fails.
Instead of designing around ""how to make tedious combat fun,"" they designed around ""how to make it harder to improve tedious combat.""
Many games are built on the concept of ""get items and skills for reducing discomfort,"" but this game's developers severely underestimated how unpleasant its early-game combat feels.

Additionally, unlocking various achievements grants access to new potential reward items—yet a staggering number of these items are literally unusable.
I don't mean ""poorly designed items."" There are masses of items intentionally designed to be nonfunctional.
Even DLCs add similarly unusable items.
Unlocking achievements to access more items should be rewarding, right? Can you name any other game where progressing puts players at a disadvantage?

This game is merely the ""pioneer of a mass-synergy enjoyment game,"" not a ""masterpiece of mass-synergy games."" It sold purely on first-mover advantage.

Side note: The game has route splits. With bad luck, you might waste 7 minutes from starting only to discover you're locked out of a specific route—even if you needed it for achievements. The developers seem to think this ""increases replayability,"" but to me, it's just a cheap tactic to inflate playtime.

Other critical design failures include: adjusting difficulty by darkening screens/hiding minimaps, implementing unavoidable RNG attacks that no skill can dodge, etc...

7.66E+16,https://steamcommunity.com/profiles/76561197999529427/,"After years of people banging on about it I decided to try the base game myself. I dislike it for 2 pretty specific reasons, so if you don't think either of the two things below bother you, be sure to go ahead and try the game yourself.

1. The game does not tell you what items do, except for a vague 1 liner that rarely gives you a good idea what the thing you just got does. Note that some items fundamentally change how you should approach the game, or might actually make your current build worse. In a game that, apparently, has hundreds of items, I can't be assed to tab out of the game every time I find a thing, or bother to try and remember for that matter. Theres a mod that apparently fixes this, but steam workshop mods require you to buy more things than the basegame to work, and I couldn't get the ""rebirth"" version of the mod I got online to work after 10 minutes of trying, and thats about the patience I have for this sort of thing in 2024.

2. If the game does not deign to give you damage increases to at least some degree, bosses are damage sponges that take about 3 times as long to fight as they should need. Theres also no real ""choice"" in build, you have to play with whatever you get, which I personally find really unengaging if it frequently leads to fighting a boss for way longer than is actually fun. The fact shops tend to sell 1 actual item and 2 minor things doesnt help either.

And thats about it. The Roguelike genre has a lot of choices these days, and there was really nothing here that stands out to me in a positive way.",Not Recommended,1264,2.2 hrs on record,"Posted: November 13, 2024"
ithinkiplaygames,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ithinkiplaygames/,"This game is genuinely bad. I'm not being cute or coy or sarcastic, it's just legitimately a terrible, bloated roguelike that's horrendously unwelcoming to new players and that locks all of its remotely interesting and fun content behind hours upon hours of tedium and slog.

The controls are bad, and the gameplay is horrifically repetitive. Almost all of your time is spent fighting twitchy, annoying enemies in cramped rooms with a weapon that does pitiful damage. Unless you get a very powerful item combo very early, you will waste 30+ minutes on a joyless, painful run that ultimately dies to some random enemy in the last 2 levels, because the game arbitrarily doubles all damage AND makes enemies harder in the final levels.

Want a level that isn't the exact same routine of Basement, Caves, Depths, Womb? Don't worry, there are other levels! All it takes to unlock them is potentially HUNDREDS of HOURS of grinding!

Also, there are multiple bosses and areas you can ONLY access by getting there quickly enough, so don't you DARE try taking your time to explore and get every advantage you can! Either luck into getting an OP run early, or screw yourself!

I can't even begin to fathom how got such a large fanbase. Was it better at some point in the past? Because right now, it sucks. If you want a top-down shooter roguelike that's actually to play, get instead.",Not Recommended,1141,52.0 hrs on record,"Posted: December 22, 2024"

snufflegrunt,https://steamcommunity.com/id/snufflegrunt/,"I've tried many times to get into BoI over the last decade or more. My hours don't reflect my real playtime since I used to play it on my crappy laptop in offline mode whenever I had no internet and no mouse. I've really given this game a chance in an effort to find that magic that many people have talked about.

What BoI really needs is a handcrafted story mode which would then unlock the procedurally-generated RNG mode. The amount of RNG involved is utterly ridiculous, to the point where player skill contributes to maybe ~20% of how successful you'll be in any given run. On top of that RNG, and compounding it, there are no descriptors of items before you pick them up, so you have to work out what they do by using them... and not all of them have positive effects and there are 100s of different items. The #1 most-downloaded mod for BoI is one that adds an item descriptor ""feature"" which should have been in there from day dot. All this comes together to make the player feel like they are not responsible for their success or failure, which is one of the worst crimes a game can commit.

While the game's theme has character, ultimately, overuse of procedural generation results in levels that lack said character. The same criticism is often (justifiably) levelled at AAA games with 1000s of staff. There is no personal touch outside of the theme and lacks soul. A handcrafted ""campaign"" would do a lot and tbh I'm surprised that it wasn't in there from the start.

The bottom line is that it's a 2011 indie game no matter how many re-releases it gets (How many must there be?!), and while it stood out from that crowd of glorified Flash games and is worthy of respect for that, there's a very good reason that roguelites have largely replaced the roguelike genre.

edit: Oooooh looks like I tripped on some people's nostalgias. Don't worry, it'll heal. The game is still only good in one respect - good for a 2011 commercial indie game, which is a low-ass bar. That era of gaming was so bad that a few years later I thought I was only ever going to like old stuff... and usually old indie stuff at that.",Not Recommended,1736,5.5 hrs on record,"Posted: October 18, 2024"

If your controls get randomised you need to start your current match in keyboard and mouse. then go into options and change controls to whatever you select.

Most of the bosses (emphasis on MOST) *cough cough* *cough* are rather balanced and usually fun to play, which is a big plus in my eyes because bosses are usually the thrill of a game. The numerous item synergies are fun to experiment with, no ♥♥♥♥ because this a game all about synergies. SOME of the characters are actually fun to play as (a personal favourite of mine being ). Alright, that's all, onto the reasons why this game is genuinely ♥♥♥♥ to play. To begin enjoying the game, you have to first get ALL the DLCs, yes, ALL OF THEM. Unless you want to play with minimal gameplay, getting them all is an absolue MUST. That doesn't sound too bad, but then you realise this game is practically entirely luck based. All the items, layouts, bosses, rewards, drops, deals, EVERYTHING is chance based. I get this is a roguelite, and roguelites HAVE to be somewhat chance based, but this is on a whole other level. Instead of blaming yourself for failure (like in Super Meat Boy, which I will bring up again), most of the time you just sit there feeling like the game simply didn't give you what you needed. What's even worse about the whole chance-based thing is the game doesn't even tell you what items do, so you have to rely on mods that do ♥♥♥♥ the game doesn't. If your game NEEDS mods for it to be playable, that's a ♥♥♥♥ game right there. It's not like it's JUST for explaining either, no, GOD no, this game also relies on mods to make enemies, bosses, gambling, and rewards less insufferable. You know how I said some characters were actually fun? well, most of them are absolutely ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ not. Most of them are just stat shuffles with some kind of active and passive item to start. either that, or their gimmick makes you want to hang yourself midgame. I mean, the game can be fun for the first few hours, but going for 100% can ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ break you, and it's not because of the game's difficulty, like Super Meat Boy, That game gives you all you need to get through the horrors it throws at you. it's more because of the gameplay of TBoI is, simply put, unfair. Now, Edmund has made some bangers in the past, but this just isn't one of them. I have over 450 hours on this game and a vast majority of them were wasted because of abysmal rewards, or telefrags from ambush spawns, or multiple consecuitive unfair rooms without health ups in-between, stuff like that. In short, this game sucks because of the same reason roguelites suck, but this game sucks more because it doubles down on what makes roguelites suck. Now , i'm not stopping you from getting this game. If you actually enjoy luck-based games (like a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ idiot), I say go for it, otherwise, I personally don't recommend.

The only problem with this game which takes it from being one of the best games to a frustrating one is the difficulty level. It's simply too difficult even on the lowest 'nornal' difficulty. The enemies get worse as you progress and they are relentless and the items you get are random so it sometimes helps very little. Even if they I produced an easy difficulty setting it might make this game more playable . I know roguelike games are meant to sometimes be difficulty but this is on another level. One of the hardest games I've ever played and takes alot of the enjoyment out of it when you can only win 1 in every 100 runs (I'm not a bad gamer) maybe with more experience you could get better.

For all the LOL GIT GUD fellas (go touch grass and get some deodorant, by the way), my issue is not the difficulty, before the last DLC I was exclusively playing Lost on Hardcore and loving it.

Items are now weaker, drop rates are altered to mostly give you garbage (wow, I love getting orbiting tears that don't actually allow me to hit anything), it's insanely hard to get both health and damage (or even one of them). And you'll need them, because the longer you play - the more boss fights just become a hail of bullets where you need to have superhuman reaction to fit between all of the hitboxes of all the ♥♥♥♥ flying around. The amount of health enemies have now is also insane, you need to have maximum health and insane damage to even have a theoretical chance to win end game fights now, it's more likely that you'll be chipping off tiny amounts of health from the boss while it just rips you apart within the first 30 seconds. There is no clever tactic involved, no alternative ways, you're either lucky to have items for high damage and high health in your run to tank all the damage while quickly killing bosses - or you're screwed, it's no longer skill-based, now it's purely luck-based. It's not as prominent in classic Rebirth levels (although Lost is still completely broken due to aforementioned guaranteed hits), but all new DLC levels are 100% like that.

And that's assuming you can even reach those bosses. Now the game really likes to constantly drop you into a room full of enemies, each of which will have some kind of laser beam (sometimes auto-aiming) that will just cover the whole room. Or boulders moving at supersonic speed. Or bombs. All of it often in almost complete darkness too. The longer you play into the run - the more it happens. Having to constantly do the tedious crap like gathering knife shards is like a cherry on top of the cake.

The resolution is also painfully low and I started getting a headache in my very short time with the game - something that virtually never happens to me.

To say this feels dated is a massive understatement. There is no reason whatsoever to play this in the new age of roguelikes, even the worst of the new roguelikes I've played feels infinitely better than this.

ObamaRunEsports,https://steamcommunity.com/id/ObamaRunEsports/,"Do not get this game if you dont find fun in the most outrageously difficult, RNG based and long roguelike games. Every run is so long that by the time you get to the boss that was challenging to you, you have forgotten that it even existed, seriously though, some bosses are incredibly hard to understand and hard to learn, especially when it costs you 20 minutes to get to the boss. Take Mom for an example, you will likely not be able to understand anything that is going on during the fight since Mom will keep slapping you, stomping on you and just spawning enemies everywhere. This gets really frustrating when you are on your 3rd run and keep dying to the same exact boss because you dont get lucky enough to tank the damage and the boss seems random to you since you havent played it enough.

If you are into that then go ahead and get the game, but I was incredibly disappointed, also i forgot to mention the 5 billion items that are either really similar or straight up useless, of course, there are still some good and important items, but there isnt really a difference between an item giving you a 1.00 increase in dmg and an item giving you a 0.90 increase in dmg. IMO it is just dumb.

Either way all of my comments are of course subjective, this just isnt the game for me, I wish i could refund it.",Not Recommended,1069,211.3 hrs on record,"Posted: July 7, 2024"

Now for what I came here to say: The game is utter TRASH. To give context, the game is too centred around bruder was items. an item will Make or proverbially break a run, especially in a crunchy battle royale game like this. ALso, its hard to abreiviate the name. The boss design is strange because why t ♥♥♥♥ is a maggot that looks like it got scraped off the side of a ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ doing all my meagre health in damage, like ♥♥♥♥♥ thats not yyour job. also also (double imperative, yes i do English) why tuh hell are all the characters naked? like BRUH is this ts some kind oif diddy party! yikes but no thank you, im out!

Abnormal7478,https://steamcommunity.com/id/Abnormal7478/,"I tried so hard to love this game. I really wanted to fall in love with it. But one its main selling points (replay value from random generation) is also one of the things absolutely kills it. Sometimes the game is downright unplayable because of the enemies that you face at super low levels. Furthermore, the enemies are absolutely atrocious. From what I've seen, there are basically three types of enemies in this game. They are either ridiculously easy to beat, downright impossible, or almost completely random. Movement is funky, and targeting is funkier. It feels like being in a wheelchair and using lobotomized aim assist.
bottom line the enemies ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ SUCK and ruin the game for at LEAST the first 1.5 hours
gameplay is deeply unsatisfying, sound design is freaky, visuals are unique but ugly, and getting a playable seed is basically just a gamble
I cannot in good faith recommend playing this game.
For reference, IMO Noita beats it in literally every category and is my favorite game in the ""Replay value/rogue ♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥♥ or whatever/random generation"" genres.
I'll probably play more of this game down the line when I'm super bored, just to see if it gets better, but playing it just feels like a chore. It's not fun.
I would love nothing more than to be balls deep into the game with a gazillion modifiers and effects stacking or whatever, but after playing for several hours I still have not gotten even a taste of that aside from some of the challenges.
last (im sure theres more) but not least, the game is cryptic in the wrong sort of way

Shooting is annoying, feels extremely wonky and soft as hell. Most rooms are either worse than bossfights or total pushovers, with the not-so-occasional ""hunt down 50 small flies scattered throughout a giant room for 3 minutes for no real purpose"" rooms. Many things are constantly happening but you can't understand any. Screen constantly full of random crap making it VERY hard to distinguish actual threats. Big bosses have unreactable attacks and no way of practicing them, meaning you'll just have to brute force it and reach them again. Some items can just kill your run without warning as THEY DONT TELL YOU WHAT THEY DO. You just have to remember what each and every item does. All hundreds of them. Also, ironically, it gets repetitive really fast.

This game is filled to the brim with content a hundred times over. However, mediocrity multiplied by more mediocrity just results in a gigantic pile of mediocrity.

zanshinq,https://steamcommunity.com/id/zanshinq/,"Fun for a while, but too repetitive, too fast and way too expensive in total.

The Binding of Isaac is a weird game with a twisted art style, story and enemies. You fight your way out of your mother's uterus, while fighting against bleeding anuses, cysts, headless people, tape worms and other vile creations. The goal is the same every time, fight your way through various levels and eventually break free of your prison.

This reskin, The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth adds nothing new or original in the base game. All of the improvements and new features are only available through the various, weird DLC’s.

This game is hard as balls. It is part of its charm and is on par with games like Super Meat Boy. I like a good challenge, although some deaths are a little cheap.

In terms of graphics, the game looks simple but nicely animated at the same time.
The gore is detailed the environments are nicely done.

The music is excellent. For some reason it captivates the weird and disturbing aesthetic of this game in a flawless way.

The controls are fluent, are easy to understand and just work.

In my own personal taste, I have a dislike for games that reset completely when you die, after collecting a lot of items, gear and coins. This is one of the reasons that I do not care for this game too much.

My problem with this game is that it is too repetitive. Sure, this can be a certain charm, but with The Binding of Isaac, I had enough after a few games. Sure, the enemies, items, environments and crazy stuff all around you changes every time you play, but the principle is still the same and gets kind of boring.

Every playthrough is also a gamble. Sometimes you get overpowered items that obliterate everything in your path, other times you are stuck with a debuff that messes up your playthrough.

To top it off, this game has very weird DLC’s, with names like Afterbirth, Afterbirth +, Repentance and Repentance +. I simply have no clue what the difference is between the normal and “+” variants or why they would make it so confusing.

These DLC’s are not cheap either and the whole set costs around 50 euros. I find this ridiculous for a simple Indie game. And yet again, the game is exactly the same as before, only with new levels, enemies, a new game mode (Some Bomber man clone) and Multiplayer support.

To be fair to it, the Multiplayer functionality is pretty fun, and the game becomes much more enjoyable when playing with friends, or in my case, my wife.

In the end, the repetitiveness, ridiculously high total price and weird DLC naming of The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth makes me not recommend this game. It is simply not for me.",Not Recommended,2190,9.7 hrs on record,Posted: April 18
